# NodeRoom

### A live room where humans and NodeAgents edit together — without clobbering each other.

**Public room chat, a private NodeAgent, and a shared spreadsheet / note / post-it wall —
with a `lock → draft → smart-merge` model so a human and an AI agent edit the same cells
through the same versioned concurrency control.**

NodeRoom is a collaborative room where a **public room NodeAgent** and your **private NodeAgent**
work alongside humans on a shared spreadsheet, note, and post-it wall. The hard part — and the
point — is that **an agent and a human never silently overwrite each other**: every edit carries a
per-element version (CAS), an agent claims an *affected range* with a lock that makes it read-only
(but still readable as context), a blocked agent **drafts** changes around the lock, and on unlock
the draft **smart-merges** and can never clobber committed work.

It runs in **two modes from the same code**:

- **No keys** — a deterministic in-memory engine + scripted agents. `npm run demo` / `npm run dev`.
- **Live** — a real **Convex** backend (reactive, optimistic) + a server-side model-routed LLM
  agent selected by `AGENT_MODEL`. Routes are promoted by ladder evidence, not provider brand.
  Verified end-to-end: the agent locks → CAS-edits → releases on real infra and the UI
  syncs reactively.

### The headline, shown literally — two clients, one room, live

</div>

A change in one client appears in the other **with no refresh**, and a **server-led agent**'s work reaches **every** client. Captured **multi-pane** — one browser context per client — with the [`feature-walkthrough-gif`](https://github.com/HomenShum/feature-walkthrough-gif#live-collaboration-multi-pane) skill (a single cursor can't show cross-client sync; this can). Two angles:

**The busy shared room.** In the live `Q3DEMO` room (with dozens of real guests already present): a human chat message syncs A→B, then `/ask reconcile Q3 revenue` runs and its result broadcasts to all — authentic, amid real concurrent activity. The older fresh-room side-by-side clip is retired from the README until it is re-captured at a more legible zoom; Gemini 3.5 Flash marked it `fix-then-publish` for small text.

![Busy shared room, two clients side by side: a chat message syncs from Client A to Client B, then a /ask agent run reconciles the sheet and broadcasts to both](docs/walkthroughs/two-client-live-sync.gif)

<sub>Both: <b>independent</b> browser clients (separate Convex sessions) side by side; sync is Convex reactive <code>useQuery</code>, the agent is server-led (<code>internalMutation</code> + scheduler) so its writes land on every client at once. A single-cursor screen capture can show neither — multi-pane is the only honest way to film a collaborative app.</sub>

## Watch it work — live walkthroughs

**Try it yourself → [noderoom.live](https://noderoom.live)** — join with a room code or start a
room; no account needed. **Status: live beta** on a dev Convex deployment. Production-readiness is
tracked **gate by gate** in [`docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`](docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md): the
no-clobber spine, agent reliability, and the public-app abuse surface (prompt-injection fencing,
join rate-limits + caps, cumulative daily spend cap, telemetry retention) are **proven by tests**;
OpenRouter's live data policy, rate-limiting + lock fencing under real concurrency, and cron SLA are
**honestly marked "needs a live audit,"** which is what keeps "beta" on
([`docs/GAPS_NOT_DONE.md`](docs/GAPS_NOT_DONE.md) has the narrative).
One privacy note before you bring real data: `/free` routes work through community free-tier
models whose providers may log prompts — keep sensitive GTM/finance figures out of `/free` runs
(the paid interactive lane does not use those routes).

Every clip below is a **captured walkthrough of the real running app UI** - not a staged hero
shot. Live-provider clips use noderoom.live + Convex; deterministic clips are explicitly marked
and use the same browser UI in memory mode so the walkthrough is stable enough to teach. You see
the empty state, the cursor glide to each click (with a ripple), the loading state, and the
result, with step captions and a progress bar. Regenerate any time with `npm run walkthroughs`
(capture) + `npm run walkthroughs:render`.

evidence for the workbench interaction, not a live-provider parser proof.</sub>

<sub>Live run, real LLM: with auto-allow off the agent's writes become inline proposals you approve at the cell. (Capturing this walkthrough originally exposed a real agent bug — the model was never told review mode existed and either burned its budget or quit without writing; fixed with a room-policy briefing + two harness guards. See <code>docs/dogfood/FRICTION_LOG.md</code>.)</sub>

<sub>Method: Playwright drives the live app through a versioned spec
([`scripts/walkthroughs/specs.ts`](scripts/walkthroughs/specs.ts)), captures clean per-state frames +

cursor, captions, and progress bar. Packaged as a reusable skill:
[`.claude/skills/readme-walkthroughs`](.claude/skills/readme-walkthroughs/SKILL.md).</sub>

### Watch the narrated episodes (click a poster — plays in your browser, with sound)

Two rendered explainers are linked below, assembled from the live captures above + real code
panels, an animated mental-model diagram, and ElevenLabs narration. Current batch media QA is
tracked in `docs/eval/MEDIA_JUDGE.md`; it is publishing evidence for the assets, not a replacement
for production gates.

| The builder story (58s) | The two-stacks story (50s) |
|---|---|
| [![I tried to make a demo GIF — it turned into a multiplayer AI workspace](episodes/noderoom-live-collab-v1/poster.jpg)](https://noderoom.live/episodes/noderoom-live-collab-v1.mp4) | [![I built it on Streamlit first — then the demo needed a second user](episodes/stack-before-after-v1/poster.jpg)](https://noderoom.live/episodes/stack-before-after-v1.mp4) |
| Naive agent clobbers a human → the code that fixes it → review mode live | The REAL Streamlit baseline (ParselyFi) → where typical stacks structurally stop → the same workflow in a live room |

The investment-room episode is retired from the README showcase until it is
re-rendered in landscape; Gemini 3.5 Flash marked the portrait render
`fix-then-publish` because desktop spreadsheet text was too cramped.

**Media QA.** The tracked README GIFs, workflow previews, and episode renders are
now batch-judgeable with Gemini video understanding: `npm run
media:gemini-judge -- --all`. GIFs are converted to temporary MP4 with ffmpeg,
then each asset gets a concrete verdict for clarity, visual design, consistency,
evidence quality, legibility, and professional-workflow relevance. Use
`--include-ignored` only when intentionally judging local capture intermediates.
Latest aggregate:
[`docs/eval/MEDIA_JUDGE.md`](docs/eval/MEDIA_JUDGE.md).

## Workflow Skill Previews

HALO is only useful if it changes the actual user-agent interaction, not just a
score file. Each workflow below has a visual preview, the user contract it must
preserve, and the eval/trace evidence that gates promotion. Refresh trace
previews with `npm run workflow:previews`, or refresh both trace previews and
real DOM captures with `npm run workflow:previews:all`. Evidence levels are
explicit: `render-workflow-preview.ts` produces trace replays, and
`workflow:app-previews` captures the real DOM in memory mode. A GIF is visual
evidence, not a production gate. Full evidence and research links:
[`docs/WORKFLOW_PREVIEWS.md`](docs/WORKFLOW_PREVIEWS.md).

### How these demos are judged

Every shipped GIF is gated by a **gemini-3.5-flash vision judge** (`npm run qa:gif`) that
decodes the shipped `.gif` itself — exact frames + real per-frame delays — and scores five
dimensions 0–10: **readability** (every label legible?), **pacing** (can a first-time viewer
follow each change?), **narrative completeness** (goal → actions → verified result?),
**visual polish** (nothing overlapping or misaligned?), and **honesty** (no glitches or UI
claiming work that isn't shown). Pass bar: **average ≥ 7, no dimension < 5**. The judge is
prompted adversarially, so read 7–8 as ship-quality, 9+ as exceptional, 5–6 as specific named
defects, < 5 as structural.

The full methodology — including **frame-level evidence** of what failing scores look like
(the literal-`null` cell bug the judge caught in the real app, before/after; the L3 conflict
story it forced us to rebuild) and the current per-dimension scoreboard — is in
[`docs/eval/GIF_JUDGE.md`](docs/eval/GIF_JUDGE.md). Verdicts with the judge's exact
frame-cited issues live in `docs/eval/gif-judge/`.

The earlier screenshot-slideshow previews were retired after this judge found structural
honesty defects (frames from different sessions, reversed narratives); the replacements are
recorded from the REAL app UI driven by the real agent runtime in memory mode
(`e2e/capture-previews.spec.ts`).

### Public `/ask` Spreadsheet Reconciliation

![/ask reconcile drives the sheet through chat](docs/eval/workflow-previews/app-ask-reconcile.gif)

User types `/ask reconcile Q3 revenue`; the Room NodeAgent creates/reuses an
`agentJobs` root, locks exact cells, reads versions, writes with CAS, releases,
and leaves visible room trace receipts.

### GTM Research Enrichment

![GTM research enrichment (real app)](docs/eval/workflow-previews/app-research-enrich.gif)

User adds or requeues accounts, then the agent enriches only pending/stale rows
with source-backed `CellPayload` values, CRM fields, citations, and freshness.

### Grounded Wiki And Note Update

User asks for a room summary; the NodeAgent discovers artifacts, reads the
source sheet, writes a grounded note/wiki update, and keeps private context out
of public surfaces unless promoted. *(Preview remains retired: Gemini 3.5 Flash
accepted the UI navigation capture as honest, but correctly rejected it as not
showing the grounding action itself. The contract is tested; the demo needs a
native grounded-update flow before it is README-ready.)*

### Proposal Review And Wall Collaboration

![Review mode: agent edits arrive as proposals](docs/eval/workflow-previews/app-proposals-review.gif)

With Auto-allow off, agent writes become host-reviewed proposals. Wall edits and
approvals stay versioned artifact mutations with conflicts surfaced in the UI.

### Long-Running `/free` Job And HALO Handoff

User starts slow free-auto work through `/free`; the same `agentJobs` contract
shows status, attempts, details, traces, receipts, and the HALO regression
handoff evidence. *(Preview retired pending a judged real-app recording; the
contract is tested in `tests/agentJobsRuntime.test.ts` and the L7 RESUME rung.)*

### Finance Model Solve

![Finance model solve](docs/eval/workflow-previews/finance-model-solve.gif)

User uploads a three-statement modeling test and asks NodeAgent to solve it.
The eval seeds the `Your Model` sheet, locks the critical forecast cells, reads
versions, writes linked formulas through CAS, releases the lock, and grades the
final artifact plus trace against a gold oracle. The GIF above is a committed
synthetic trace replay so the media can stay public; the private workbook runs
locally and its answer-key formulas never enter the agent's context or the repo
(`evals/financeModelLive.ts`; content-based leakage gate). The private live
proof is the redacted summary in `docs/eval/finance-model-live.json`.

**The live scoreboard is the point, and it's honest:** the full-solve champion
claim is a **measured reliability batch, not a best run**.
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` passed **5/5 model-owned runs** of the full
private-workbook lane (16/16 linked forecast cells each, lock → read →
CAS-write → release, no answer-key leakage) **across three room variants** —
clean room, a room salted with distractor artifacts that reuse the target cell
ids, and a concurrent human edit landing mid-run (the human's cell survives;
their write into the locked range is rejected). Median 105.0s, p95 $0.1068/run,
$0.4424 total, zero provider-owned failures
(`docs/eval/finance-model-live.json`, attempt-by-attempt ledger included; the
claim goes stale-red in CI 30 days after `generatedAt` — `npm run
proofs:staleness`). The free route `nex-agi/nex-n2-pro:free` is promoted only
through the income rung for now (6/6 in 74.1s at $0); its full rerun hit an
OpenRouter invalid-JSON provider failure after lock/read — recorded as
`failureOwner: provider`, not a model failure, and not a promotion.

The HALO ladder also renders trace-replayed skill previews from real ladder JSON
(`l1-read` through `l6-long-horizon`) in `docs/eval/workflow-previews/`, so a
workflow change has a small visual proof, not only a text score.

### Managed Locks: What To Give The Agent

The first lock/CAS evals intentionally made the model call `propose_lock -> edit_cell -> release_lock` so we could prove it understood the collaboration protocol. Production should not keep paying for that once the invariant is proven. The production bundle now exposes `write_locked_cells` / `write_locked_cell_results`: the model supplies target cells, values/formulas/evidence, and base versions; the runtime acquires the range lock, writes with CAS, drafts if blocked, releases in `finally`, and returns coordination evidence.

| Lane | Evidence | Model calls | Agent tool calls | Model-visible lock calls | Tool trace |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Explicit lock tools | deterministic runtime | 7 | 6 | 2 | `propose_lock -> read_range -> edit_cell -> read_range -> edit_cell -> release_lock` |
| Runtime-managed lock | deterministic runtime | 3 | 2 | 0 | `read_range -> write_locked_cells` |
| Explicit lock tools | live `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | 5 | 5 | 2 | `read_range -> propose_lock -> edit_cell -> edit_cell -> release_lock` |
| Runtime-managed lock | live `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | 4 | 3 | 0 | `read_range -> write_locked_cells -> read_range` |

The safety invariant did not move to the model: `tests/managedLockTools.test.ts` injects a human write during the managed write and proves it is blocked while the runtime-held lock is active. `npm run eval:multiuser-coordination` extends that to a multi-actor proof: human-vs-human same-cell edits converge with one winner and one CAS conflict, target writes are blocked, non-target peer writes continue, stale bases conflict, blocked second agents draft, and every path releases its lock. The eval artifacts are [`docs/eval/managed-lock-performance.json`](docs/eval/managed-lock-performance.json), [`docs/eval/managed-lock-performance-live.json`](docs/eval/managed-lock-performance-live.json), [`docs/eval/multi-user-coordination-proof.json`](docs/eval/multi-user-coordination-proof.json), [`docs/eval/MANAGED_LOCK_PERF.md`](docs/eval/MANAGED_LOCK_PERF.md), and [`docs/eval/MULTI_USER_COORDINATION_PROOF.md`](docs/eval/MULTI_USER_COORDINATION_PROOF.md).

**Rule of thumb:** give the agent business intent, target cells, formulas/values/evidence, and base versions. Take away lock acquisition, unlock sequencing, range coordination, draft-on-blocked mechanics, and release cleanup. Deterministic coordination belongs in the harness.

### Algorithm Artifacts: Learn Like AI, Run Like Code

The next tool-contract lesson is the same one artifact systems teach for
generated UI: model output should become a durable artifact the runtime can
inspect and rerun, not a one-off answer. For NodeRoom spreadsheets, the artifact
is a deterministic calculation plan.

`run_algorithm_artifact` now lets the model submit a narrow
`spreadsheet_formula` artifact with named input cells, output cells, formula-DSL
expressions, deterministic constraints, and small fixtures. The runtime reads
the current versioned cells, validates the artifact, runs the fixture tests,
materializes evidence-bearing `CellPayload` patches, and returns a patch bundle
plus ready-to-pass `write_locked_cell_results` arguments. It does **not** commit.
The managed write tool still owns lock, CAS, proposal/review, draft behavior, and
trace evidence.

The checked proof is [`docs/eval/algorithm-artifact-smoke.json`](docs/eval/algorithm-artifact-smoke.json):
`revenue_variance_pct_v1` computes `(q3 - q2) / q2` from source cells, passes its
fixture, writes `+24.0%` through `write_locked_cell_results`, preserves the
formula on the resulting `CellPayload`, and attaches three evidence entries
(algorithm proof plus two source-cell refs). `tests/algorithmArtifacts.test.ts`
also proves deterministic rerun on a changed snapshot, managed-write application,
and rejection of unknown identifiers or non-deterministic constraints.

This is intentionally L1/L2 only: formula/DSL artifacts. Convex persistence,
artifact promotion/version UI, workbook-wide runtime adapters, and any sandboxed
code lane remain tracked gaps. The product rule is stricter now: high-stakes
calculation work should be authored by AI when useful, but committed only after a
deterministic runner turns it into auditable patches.

### Where the walkthroughs go next

The clip set expands along the **six user → agent interaction modes** from the
[eval checklist](docs/AGENT_EVAL.md) — every mode that earns a passing eval
earns a captured walkthrough, in this order:

1. **Teach me (Guide mode)** — the agent coaches a student through the model
   with **zero writes to answer cells**; the clip shows hints landing while the
   sheet stays agent-untouched (restraint is the visual).
2. **Modeling test · Collaborate** — agent + two humans split IS/BS/CF under
   range locks; drafts smart-merge on release across shared linkage rows.
3. **L7 RESUME live** — slice death mid-job, a human revises a cell while the
   agent is dead, the cold continuation finishes only what remains.
4. **File-drop ingestion** — a 10-K PDF + XLSX dropped into the room becomes a
   cited sheet (plus the receipts → expense-report variant).
5. **Sensitive-query guardrail** — the private agent declining specific
   financial advice *with a stated reason* (the discretion clip).
6. **Spend-cap breach attribution** — `global_monthly_spend_cap:rooms=N`
   rendered as the growth-vs-runaway diagnosis it encodes.

## Audience-World Proof Artifacts

NodeRoom's distribution story should not be "look at this AI workspace." The stronger proof is:
**here is what happens when high-trust teams need to coordinate research, decisions, documents,
spreadsheets, advisors, and AI without losing discretion, accuracy, provenance, or control.**
That matters for GTM sales teams and finance/banker workflows, and it matters even more for
private-client contexts where the buyer recognizes the operating texture before they trust the
software.

The repo now treats that as an eval surface, not marketing copy:

- Audience research lives in [`episodes/_audiences/`](episodes/_audiences/). The current canonical
  lane is [`family-office.yaml`](episodes/_audiences/family-office.yaml), which captures values,
  repeated questions, recognizable artifacts, product mappings, trust signals, and source notes.
- The reusable agent contract is [`docs/skills/audience-fluency/SKILL.md`](docs/skills/audience-fluency/SKILL.md):
  audience research → client-world map → scenario translation → lexicon mining → trust-signal check
  → cultural-fluency eval.
- The first affluent/private-investment scenario is
  [`episodes/private-investment-room-v1/brief.md`](episodes/private-investment-room-v1/brief.md):
  a private investment team preparing for an IC meeting, where the product proof is not "AI fills
  cells" but "who changed what, from which source, and what can the principal safely review?"
- The already-rendered generic engineering explainer is
  [`episodes/noderoom-live-collab-v1/report.md`](episodes/noderoom-live-collab-v1/report.md), with
  Gemini video-understanding judge evidence at
  [`episodes/noderoom-live-collab-v1/judge.md`](episodes/noderoom-live-collab-v1/judge.md).

Run `npm run content:fluency:check` to keep this layer honest. Current status is **yellow**:
the audience context, private-investment brief, rendered episode, and Gemini
media judge are present, but content-fluency/trust-signal review and current
media judge defects still need to be closed before it can be called
production-proven.

## Why Convex (and why not)

NodeRoom's entire product is one loop: **human edit → optimistic client store → agent action →
internal mutation → reactive query stream → every screen updates**. Convex is the only piece of
infrastructure in this repo because that loop is exactly what it sells natively: transactional
mutations (serializable OCC), reactive subscriptions over WebSockets, and a scheduler — the
pub/sub, cache-invalidation, and message-broker layers you'd otherwise hand-build. The no-clobber
spine (per-element CAS + affected-range locks + draft-merge) rides *on top* of Convex's OCC; the
database's own concurrency control protects transactions, and the app-level versions protect
*intent* — both layers are needed, and [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) shows where each one catches what.

**The pedigree is real.** Convex was built by Dropbox infrastructure veterans — Jamie Turner
(ex-Dropbox senior engineering leadership) and James Cowling, the MIT PhD (under Turing-laureate
Barbara Liskov) who architected **Magic Pocket**, the exabyte-scale storage system that moved
Dropbox off S3. They built Convex after a decade of watching every team rebuild the same
sync/invalidation machinery they'd built at Dropbox. The engine is hardened by **deterministic
simulation testing** — the database, message bus, and runtime execute in a single-threaded
simulated sandbox where network drops, clock drift, and write collisions are injected millions of
times, so race conditions are caught deterministically before release.

**And the honest trade-offs** (why it isn't everywhere, and why we accepted them):

| Trade-off | Reality | Why it's acceptable *here* |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime coupling | Schema, transactions, and functions are tied to Convex's engine — no lift-and-shift to raw SQL over a weekend | The engine seams (`RoomTools`, the in-memory `RoomEngine`) keep the collaboration logic portable; Convex is the *port*, not the *spine* |
| OLTP, not OLAP | This is a real-time transactional store; scanning billions of rows for analytics is the wrong tool | NodeRoom is the textbook OLTP case: small hot documents, high-frequency concurrent reads/writes, agents and humans interleaved |
| Enterprise adoption lag | Conservative stacks take a decade to absorb a new paradigm | A spike that exists to prove agent-collaboration patterns should optimize for iteration speed, not procurement checklists |

What this combination unlocks is the category NodeRoom lives in: **AI-augmented collaborative
canvases** — where a background agent's mutation and a human's keystroke flow through the same
transaction log and the same reactive stream, so neither ever waits on (or clobbers) the other.
The same loop powers the adjacent categories — self-healing QA sandboxes where a human corrects a
stuck agent mid-run, and multi-agent operational simulations watched by many operators — without
an enterprise-sized DevOps budget. Full stack rationale: [docs/STACK.md](docs/STACK.md).
Workbook MVP rationale: [docs/architecture/MVP_WORKBOOK_STACK.md](docs/architecture/MVP_WORKBOOK_STACK.md).

## Lessons From Building NodeRoom

This repo is intentionally written as a learning artifact, not just a runnable
demo. The main lesson from iterating on NodeRoom is that useful professional AI
systems are mostly **harness engineering and context engineering**. The model is
allowed to reason and propose; bounded tools own mutation, versions, permissions,
traceability, file evidence, budgets, and recovery. That is the through-line from
the first lock/CAS spreadsheet demo to the current GTM, finance, file parsing,
long-running job, and QA matrix work.

The professional workflow review changed the project. A local corpus of 70
spreadsheet files became the eval backlog: 23 CSVs, 47 XLSX files, 46
GTM/company-research files, 11 finance/ops files, 47 header-level PII signals,
16 formula-bearing workbooks, and 18 merged-cell workbooks. Private rows were
not committed; the durable artifact is the workflow shape. See
[`docs/eval/PROFESSIONAL_WORKFLOW_EVALS.md`](docs/eval/PROFESSIONAL_WORKFLOW_EVALS.md)
and [`evals/professionalWorkflows.ts`](evals/professionalWorkflows.ts).

### What The Professional Files Taught

| Workflow | User job | Harness lesson |
|---|---|---|
| GTM sales / company research | Upload PitchBook, ParselyFi, JPM, sector-tagging, and AMO-style lists **or start from chat**: "just spoke with X at startup Y" / "company Y just raised $Z"; classify, enrich, create/update watchlists, preserve CRM fields, and cite sources. | Do not let the agent write loose text. ENRICH / CLASSIFY / RESOLVE writes need `CellPayload` values with status, confidence, and evidence; chat claims stay `manual` evidence until verified by fetched or artifact sources. |
| Finance / banker workflows | Upload spend exports, transaction files, timecards, timesheets, and income/expense templates; reconcile or populate bounded cells. | Preserve formulas and layout, skip already-correct cells, cite source rows, and mask sensitive values in public output. |
| Parser and document workflows | Work across CSV/XLSX plus PDFs, Office files, screenshots, OCR, and layout/bounding boxes. | Keep raw room files canonical; provider file ids are cache metadata. Provider extraction and LiteParse-style local parsing both normalize into evidence-bearing artifacts. |
| Long-running research / ops | Run slow free models, bulk classification, and multi-file enrichment past one action window. | Split work into budgeted slices, compact context, checkpoint state, record attempts, and resume through durable jobs rather than trusting one giant call. |
| Interview / QA workflows | Explain exactly what the agent did and how it was verified. | Treat traces, wiki updates, evals, and the QA matrix as product surfaces, not afterthoughts. |

### How The Agent Harness Evolved

1. **Prompt wrapper -> agent harness.** `src/agent/runtime.ts` is a bounded loop:
   context -> one model step -> validated tool calls -> tool results -> repeat.
   The three seams in [`src/agent/types.ts`](src/agent/types.ts) are model,
   tools, and `RoomTools`, so the same loop runs with a scripted model,
   in-memory engine, live Convex backend, and provider routes.

2. **Static prompt -> protocol plus just-in-time context.**
   [`src/agent/systemPrompt.ts`](src/agent/systemPrompt.ts) carries the rules:
   look first, claim exact ranges, edit with the version read, release, and
   narrate. [`src/agent/context.ts`](src/agent/context.ts) injects the current
   sheet, versions, locks, awareness, and artifact refs. The version tags are
   what make CAS possible.

3. **Database OCC -> app-level no-clobber.** Convex optimistic concurrency
   protects transactions, not stale intent. NodeRoom still needs per-element
   versions. A lock prevents races; CAS catches stale writes; a blocked agent
   drafts instead of forcing. The L1-L7 ladder in [`evals/ladder.ts`](evals/ladder.ts)
   makes that measurable.

4. **Scalar spreadsheet values -> evidence-bearing cell payloads.** GTM and
   finance workflows need answers users can audit. Parser extraction,
   enrichment, classification, reconciliation, and wiki/report updates carry
   source evidence back to the durable room artifact. See
   [`tests/workflowEvals.test.ts`](tests/workflowEvals.test.ts) and
   [`tests/providerParserAdapter.test.ts`](tests/providerParserAdapter.test.ts).

5. **One file id -> two identities.** Raw Convex/NodeRoom file and artifact ids
   are the system of record. Gemini/OpenAI/Claude/OpenRouter file ids are
   provider caches. This keeps permissions, provenance, and cache expiry from
   being mixed together.

6. **Chat-only UI -> room workbench.** The room now has public chat, private
   NodeAgent, clickable files, spreadsheet, note/wiki, wall, room trace,
   drag-to-chat artifact refs, proposal review, host accept-all, and host-gated
   auto-accept. The UI is not decoration; it is how humans inspect evidence and
   control agent writes.

7. **Single action -> durable sliced workflow.** Mutating or long-running agent
   commands create or reuse a durable `agentJobs` row; private read-only advise
   can stay a one-call private reply until it needs continuation or mutation.
   `/ask` runs the first slice immediately for responsive UX; if it exhausts
   step or time budget, it checkpoints cursor state and resumes through the same
   Workflow/Workpool slice runner. The continuation function is still named
   `freeAutoWorkflow` from its first use case, but it preserves the job's model
   policy, so `/ask` and `/free` share the durable contract. `/free` is a
   model-policy shortcut that forces
   `openrouter/free-auto`, not a second agent architecture. The remaining
   production hardening is stricter deadline/tool abort behavior, provider
   request idempotency where available, and model health/quarantine. See
   [`docs/LONG_RUNNING_AGENTS.md`](docs/LONG_RUNNING_AGENTS.md).

8. **Model benchmark -> model routing gate.** The cheapest model that passes a
   flat research benchmark is not automatically safe for collaboration. Live
   provider results are recorded in
   [`docs/eval/live-provider-agent-ladder-2026-06-08.md`](docs/eval/live-provider-agent-ladder-2026-06-08.md):
   provider connectivity is not the same as lock/CAS/draft safety.

9. **Ad hoc docs -> governed memory.** The wiki and docs use stable sections,
   clickable artifact refs, room-visible evidence, and private-context rules.
   The self-updating wiki skill is documented in
   [`docs/skills/self-updating-wiki/SKILL.md`](docs/skills/self-updating-wiki/SKILL.md).

10. **Manual confidence -> append-only QA ledger.** Every new user-facing
    feature, agent tool, provider route, or production invariant should update
    [`docs/qa/production-matrix.json`](docs/qa/production-matrix.json) and run
    `npm run qa:matrix`. The generated QA cockpit below is how the README stays
    honest as the system grows.

11. **One backend -> data by access pattern.** Convex/realtime state owns room
    truth, artifact versions, messages, locks, proposals, traces, and
    permissions. Object storage owns large uploads and generated exports. A hot
    cache should hold only version-keyed ephemeral data such as presence, room
    tails, recent sheet ranges, idempotency windows, and semantic answer cache.
    CDN is for static assets and explicitly public artifacts, while serverless
    actions/workers own bursty parsing, retrieval, model calls, exports, and
    evals.

12. **AI code -> simplification gate.** New architecture is treated as a first
    draft until it has a direct workflow hook, a test/eval, and a reason a
    simpler existing module cannot own it. The current watch list is in
    [`docs/OVERENGINEERING_AUDIT.md`](docs/OVERENGINEERING_AUDIT.md).

The detailed interview version of this story lives in
[`docs/INTERVIEW_NOTES.md`](docs/INTERVIEW_NOTES.md). The product support map
for the reviewed GTM and finance files lives in
[`docs/PROFESSIONAL_SPREADSHEET_WORKFLOWS.md`](docs/PROFESSIONAL_SPREADSHEET_WORKFLOWS.md).

The full **design rationale** — *every* architecture "why", the trade-offs, the live-collaboration
differences versus the past **Streamlit (ParselyFi)** and **Next.js + SSE client GraphStore**
projects, and the **HALO self-improvement loop** (how a replayable trace becomes a Codex / Claude Code
handoff so the agent improves its own harness, eval-gated) — lives in
[`docs/WHY_NODEAGENT_AND_HALO.md`](docs/WHY_NODEAGENT_AND_HALO.md). The founder thesis there: a solo
builder can't hand-verify every trace, but professional workflows (IB diligence, GTM sales, middle-market
banking, corporate-finance analysis, marketing) are *researchable online* — so the internet supplies the
spec, the eval supplies the contract, and the loop supplies the labor.

## Provider-Step Journal

The long-running path uses a durable model-step journal so Workflow retries do
not re-call a provider after a completed model response has already been
recorded. This is the reliability boundary behind the "run past 10 minutes"
claim: checkpoint state resumes the job, while the journal prevents duplicate
provider billing for completed steps.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Client command<br/>/ask or /free"] --> B["agentJobs row<br/>intent + model policy"]
  B --> C["Slice runner<br/>inline action or Workflow/Workpool"]
  C --> D["Derive sliceKey<br/>job + cursor or artifact version + goal + model"]
  D --> E{"Journal row?<br/>jobId + sliceKey + step"}
  E -- "yes" --> F["Replay stored AgentStep<br/>0 provider calls<br/>0 new tokens"]

  J -- "yes" --> K["Complete job<br/>runs + steps + receipts + trace"]
  J -- "budget hit" --> L["Checkpoint cursor/handoff<br/>Workflow sleeps then resumes"]
  L --> C
```

The remaining edge case is a crash before the provider response is committed to
the journal; provider request idempotency keys are the next adapter-level
hardening where supported.

## The three layers

```
  UI (src/ui)  ──useStore()──▶  src/app/store.tsx  ──▶  RoomEngine (in-memory)   ← no keys
                                       └──────────────▶  Convex (useQuery + CAS) ← live
  Agent (src/agent)  ──RoomTools──▶  InMemoryRoomTools  |  ConvexRoomTools (convex/)
```

1. **The collaboration engine** (`src/engine/`) — the truth. Every artifact is a bag of
   **elements** (`{ id, version, value }`), so locks, CAS, drafts, and smart-merge are **one**
   generic mechanism. Pure, deterministic, 12 scenario tests.
2. **The agent harness** (`src/agent/`) — context engineering + tool construction + a bounded loop
   with an **injectable model** (scripted or routed real provider) and a **swappable backend** (in-memory
   or Convex). Context **compaction** keeps long runs bounded. See [`docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md`](docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md).
3. **The store seam** (`src/app/store.tsx`) — the UI calls `useStore()`; one provider is the
   in-memory engine, the other is live Convex with **optimistic updates**. The components don't change.

## The collaboration model

- **CAS** — `applyCellEdit` checks the element `version`; a stale base returns `{conflict, expected, actual}`
  **as data, never a throw**. (Convex's OCC alone does *not* stop a stale-base clobber — the app-level version does.)
- **Lock** — `proposeLock(elementIds)` makes an affected range read-only for non-holders; reads still
  return it (**locked ≠ invisible**). The lock *prevents* races; CAS *catches* the ones with no lock.
- **Draft → smart-merge** — a blocked agent drafts around the lock; on release the draft applies on
  untouched elements, no-ops if already equal, and **flags-without-applying if diverged**. Committed work is never clobbered.
- **Auto-allow** — when OFF, agent edits become proposals for host approve/reject; humans always apply directly.

## Live collaboration sequence

This is the actual multi-user path readers should hold in their head. The
browser may paint optimistically, but Convex mutations own durable writes, the
NodeAgent writes through the same checked mutations as humans, and Workflow /
Workpool only continues a checkpointed job; it is not the source of truth.

  end
```

Production uses managed write tools. The explicit `propose_lock -> edit_cell -> release_lock`
sequence remains useful in ladder evals and debug traces, but the production bundle hides those
coordination tools from the model. One visible `write_locked_cells` call expands inside the
runtime/mutation layer like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant Agent as "NodeAgent"
  participant Mutation as "Convex mutation"
  participant Peer as "Peer browser"
  participant DB as "Convex DB"

  Agent->>Mutation: write_locked_cells(ops, baseVersions)
  Mutation->>DB: acquire exact target-range lock
  par peer edits target cell
    Peer->>Mutation: applyCellEdit(target, peerBaseVersion)
    Mutation-->>Peer: locked result as data
  and peer edits outside target range
    Peer->>Mutation: applyCellEdit(otherCell, currentVersion)
    Mutation->>DB: CAS commit allowed
  end
  Mutation->>DB: apply each target op with CAS
  alt target base is current
    Mutation->>DB: write element, bump version, receipt
  else target base is stale
    Mutation-->>Agent: conflict result as data
  end
  Mutation->>DB: release lock in finally
  Mutation->>DB: merge blocked drafts or flag review conflicts
  DB-->>Peer: reactive canonical state
```

`npm run eval:multiuser-coordination` is the deterministic proof for that expansion: human-vs-human
same-cell edits converge with one winner and one CAS conflict, target writes block, non-target writes
continue, stale writes conflict, blocked agents draft, smart-merge runs on release, and all scenarios end
with zero active locks. The generated artifact is
[`docs/eval/multi-user-coordination-proof.json`](docs/eval/multi-user-coordination-proof.json),
with the method documented in [`docs/eval/MULTI_USER_COORDINATION_PROOF.md`](docs/eval/MULTI_USER_COORDINATION_PROOF.md). The next promotion layer is the gated browser/live Convex spec: `E2E_LIVE=1 E2E_REQUIRE_REVIEW_MODE=1 npx playwright test e2e/three-user-collab.spec.ts --project=chromium`.

The long form, including file/provider extraction and architecture alternatives
against client-side SSE, REST polling, CRDT/local-first, and worker-queue
designs, lives in
[`docs/LIVE_COLLABORATION_SEQUENCES.md`](docs/LIVE_COLLABORATION_SEQUENCES.md).

## The agent — runtime, context, eval

The agent is the centerpiece, built to be *explained* and *trusted*. **Type `/ask <goal>`
in the public chat to drive the Room NodeAgent end-to-end** - it reads current versions, calls managed write tools, and lets the runtime expand lock/CAS/draft/release internally (the real `runRoomAgent` action when on Convex; the real in-memory harness with no keys).

- **Runtime + context engineering + tool backend** → [`docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md`](docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md).
  Three seams (model · tools · RoomTools), the loop, the system-prompt protocol + JIT context, and
  the CAS mutation that makes "no silent clobber" true.
- **Evaluation framework** → [`docs/AGENT_EVAL.md`](docs/AGENT_EVAL.md). Who the users are, their use
  cases, the golden-case schema, single/multi/long-running references, and 10 metrics led by
  **no-silent-clobber rate**. Runnable: `npm run eval` (deterministic) / `npm run eval:real`.
- **Feature eval backlog** → [`docs/eval/FEATURE_EVAL_BACKLOG.md`](docs/eval/FEATURE_EVAL_BACKLOG.md).
  Public/private gold sources, workflow contracts, and route-proof gates for the next features.

### The user → agent eval checklist

Everything the agent is tested on — or owes a test — sorted by the **six ways a user puts
NodeAgent to work**. The full per-case inventory (with file refs and recorded results) lives in
[`docs/AGENT_EVAL.md` § 0](docs/AGENT_EVAL.md); this is the honest scoreboard:

| Interaction mode | Running today | Designed, to build |
|---|---|---|
| **1 - Do it for me** (autonomous solve) | variance/footnote/note/wall goldens - GTM research enrichment (v3 cheap/free smoke, 18/28 routes 9/9) - executable professional subset (GTM runtime enrichment, messy-sheet parsing, cross-file note write, grounded wiki update, finance reconciliation) - chat-first lead capture through live room tools (`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, 100%) - credit cascade + cell-mapping rejection - 3-statement modeling test Solve (private full lane, measured: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` 5/5 model-owned across base/distractor/concurrent-edit rooms, median 105.0s, p95 $0.1068/run) | background chat-to-research intake - SEC model-build flagship - N-doc research (benchmark v4) - file-drop ingestion (10-K/XLSX/receipts) - knowledge-organization pack |
| **2 · Do it with us** (live collaboration) | ladder **L1–L7 scripted** + **L1–L4 live** across 11 routes (full passes: `gemini-3.5-flash`, `nemotron-3-ultra` — the research champion fails L1/L4, proving lanes promote separately) · multi-turn provenance · sustained concurrent room · lease fencing/takeover | L5–L7 live · modeling test (Collaborate: split IS/BS/CF under locks) · L8 roles/redaction · L9 entity resolution · L10 cross-artifact · live adversarial-source rung |
| **3 · Work under review** (proposals) | review-mode inline proposals + room-policy briefing regression | contractor-time professional approval fixture · L8 formalizes role-gated approve/promote/redact |
| **4 · Advise me privately** (read-only consult) | private no-tools reply path · private-draft redaction · prompt-injection fencing 4/4 | sensitive-query guardrail (decline with stated reason) |
| **5 · Work in the background** (resumable jobs) | durable `agentJobs` + exactly-once journal · L7 RESUME scripted · spend caps (slice/day/month) with breach attribution | L7 live across routes · 100-row checkpointed batch with partial-success reporting |
| **6 · Teach me** (guided solve) | — | modeling test (Guide): **zero writes to answer cells**, hint quality, student convergence — restraint as a first-class eval axis |

Cross-cutting and always on: the eval store + `eval:diff` regression gate, the supported-route
model matrix (research and collaboration promote **separately**), the HALO improvement loop, and
the Gemini media judge on every published clip.

Professional proof state:

- `npm run eval:professional:catalog-proofs` proves **21/21** professional catalog cases at the deterministic catalog layer.
- `npm run eval:professional:live-catalog -- --real deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash --require-full` proves **21/21** catalog contracts with a live OpenRouter route.
- Route cross-checks: `ibm-granite/granite-4.1-8b` completed the full catalog at **19/21** (`finance-cost-reconciliation` missed `validCaseId`; `eval-ui-action-execution-map` missed `reviewIfNeeded`), `z-ai/glm-4.7-flash` passed a 3-case smoke but full-catalog timing is too slow for the current runner, and `nex-agi/nex-n2-pro:free` passed a 1-case smoke after the full sweep timed out.
- `npm run eval:chat-intake:live -- --managed-locks` proves the chat-first GTM workflow through the real room runtime with `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`: production-managed `write_locked_cell_results` / `write_locked_cells`, evidenced writes, CAS duplicate prevention, unresolved Caldera, one private clarifying question, release evidence, and no public PII leak.
- `npm run eval:professional:live-runtime -- --strict` proves **21/21** professional catalog cases execute through the real room runtime with `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, `PRODUCTION_ROOM_TOOLS`, evidence payload writes, and runtime-managed lock coordination.

- `npm run eval:professional:proofs` now records **5 live-provider**, **16 partial live-provider**, **0 live-provider catalog**, **0 deterministic runtime**, and **0 contract-shape** cases; its live runtime smoke is **21/21**, and lock-mode counts are **21 runtime-managed**, **0 explicit-agent-lock**, and **0 catalog-only**.
- **Context compaction** (`src/agent/compaction.ts`) — elides stale `read_range` results (Claude
  "context editing" pattern), preserves the turn structure (Hermes), keeps the latest state + recent turns.
- **Library stack** (TipTap, dnd-kit, lucide, assistant-ui, the `@convex-dev/*` components) → [`docs/STACK.md`](docs/STACK.md).

The per-rung previews below are **trace replays** — the same agent-runtime tool calls (L1–L3 from a live
`gemini-3.5-flash` run, L4/L6 from the deterministic engine) drawn into a clean sheet by
[`scripts/render-workflow-preview.ts`](scripts/render-workflow-preview.ts), so each rung has an isolated
visual of the `lock → CAS → draft → smart-merge` protocol the [HALO loop](#agent-improvement-loop)
re-verifies every cycle. The rungs L1–L7 are the [`evals/ladder.ts`](evals/ladder.ts) bar that turns
"completed" into "right tool, no clobber, in budget."

**L7 · RESUME (slice death + cold continuation)** is the newest rung and tests the promise long-running
jobs actually depend on: slice 1 gets the full task but a step budget that kills it mid-way (a real
exhaustion + handoff, not a simulated flag); while the agent is dead a human revises one of its
completed cells; slice 2 is a **fresh context** — no conversation memory, only room state and the
handoff — and must finish only the remaining targets. Pass requires: completed work untouched, the
human's between-slice revision left standing, fresh read provenance for every slice-2 edit, and no
lock shortcut. This is the rung that separates "can edit a sheet" from "can be trusted with a
checkpointed background job."

### Evidence Levels

The README uses evidence labels deliberately:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Deterministic catalog proof | A typed professional case passed checks for intake surface, output contract, provenance, trajectory, privacy/long-running/private-gold contracts, and requirement-proof evidence. This is not live model proof. |
| Deterministic runtime | A local harness executed real NodeRoom logic and checked final artifact state plus trace behavior without provider nondeterminism. |
| DOM preview | Playwright captured the real NodeRoom UI, usually in memory mode, to verify the visible workflow. |
| Deterministic replay | A scripted or fixture trace replayed through the real harness without provider nondeterminism. |
| Live provider | A real model/provider produced the agent trace or media judge result. |
| Live Convex | The path crossed the deployed Convex backend and reactive clients, not only the in-memory engine. |

Promotion claims require the level named in the QA matrix; a nice GIF is not a
production gate by itself.

### Judging Methodology

NodeRoom uses a tiered judge stack, not one blended score. Deterministic checks
grade artifact state, trace shape, locks/CAS, provenance, privacy, and budgets
first. LLM or vision judges are used only where the output is inherently
semantic or visual, and their verdicts are recorded with the trace instead of
silently replacing deterministic gates. Regression evidence is append-only and
case-keyed (`commitSha`, `caseId`, `ts`) so `npm run eval:diff` can say which
case degraded, by how much, and which check broke. This follows the current
production-eval pattern from
[Braintrust trace/score tracking](https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/llm-evaluation-guide),
[LangSmith curated regression datasets](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/evaluation),
and [OpenAI-style custom evals](https://github.com/openai/evals) for the
workflows that actually matter to the product.

### L1 · Read — answer without touching

![Read workflow](docs/eval/workflow-previews/l1-read.gif)

The agent reports a cell's value and changes nothing. The discipline is *not writing*: read the exact
cell, return it, stop.
**Research / repo:** just-in-time context + read-before-write — Anthropic, *Effective context
engineering for AI agents*; the scratchpad-first pattern.

### L2 · Edit with CAS — claim, read the version, compare-and-set

![Edit workflow](docs/eval/workflow-previews/l2-edit.gif)

The agent locks the exact cell, reads its `version`, and writes with that version as the CAS baseline.
A write whose baseline is stale is rejected, not applied.
**Research / repo:** application-level optimistic concurrency beyond DB OCC — per-element `version` in
[`convex/schema.ts`](convex/schema.ts) + the `applyCellEdit` check; classic OCC (Kung & Robinson, 1981).

### L3 · No clobber — a human edits mid-write

![No-clobber workflow](docs/eval/workflow-previews/l3-no-clobber.gif)

A human edits the same cell while the agent is working. The agent's stale-baseline write hits a
**conflict** — surfaced as *data*, not an exception — so it re-reads and retries. Committed human work
is never overwritten.
**Research / repo:** conflict-as-data + retry — Convex transactional OCC is necessary but not sufficient;
the per-element CAS check is what prevents the clobber.
the conflict-as-data / async-reliability pattern.

### L4 · Draft when blocked — the range is locked

![Draft workflow](docs/eval/workflow-previews/l4-draft.gif)

Another agent holds an affected-range lock. Instead of forcing, the agent **drafts** its change
(`create_draft`) for smart-merge on unlock, and never writes directly through the lock.
**Research / repo:** propose/draft + smart-merge over force-write — proposal/draft tables in
[`convex/schema.ts`](convex/schema.ts); the scratchpad-first pattern,
Anthropic *Building Effective Agents*.

### L5 · Large range — 600 rows, load only the window

![Large-range workflow](docs/eval/workflow-previews/l5-large-range.gif)

A 600-row operating model; the agent loads only the 5-row window around the target, never the full
sheet, touches only the allowed cell, and stays inside a bounded context budget.
**Research / repo:** just-in-time context windows over full-snapshot loading — `rangeContext` in
[`evals/ladder.ts`](evals/ladder.ts); Anthropic *Effective context engineering*.

### L6 · Long horizon — many cells, repeated conflicts, compaction

![Long-horizon workflow](docs/eval/workflow-previews/l6-long-horizon.gif)

Fill five cells under repeated concurrent edits, **compacting context** as the window fills, recovering
from each conflict, never locking, all inside a wall-clock budget.
**Research / repo:** orchestrator durability + context compaction —
the orchestrator-workers pattern,
the layered-memory pattern; Anthropic *Effective context engineering*.

> The previews replay genuine agent-runtime traces (the tool protocol + CAS results are real).
> Live provider evidence exists for selected L1-L4 routes; the free-auto/top-5 router ladder
> failed overall. L5-L6 preview evidence is deterministic unless a separate live run is recorded.

## Agent improvement loop

NodeRoom uses the same loop described in OpenAI's Agents SDK cookbook: real traces, human/model
feedback, reusable evals, a validation gate, and a Codex handoff — then it repeats.

**HALO — Hierarchical Agent Loop Optimization**

![HALO loop](docs/eval/halo-loop-diagram.svg)

| # | Stage | What happens | Where in this repo |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Trace** | every agent run records a replayable trace (tools, args, results, versions) | `writeTraceArtifact` (`evals/ladder.ts`) · `agentSteps` (convex) |
| 2 | **Feedback** | three sources score the run: trace signals, human, LLM-judge | trace checks · review · judge |
| 3 | **Evals** | each rung raises the bar from "completed" to "right tool, no clobber, in budget" | `evals/ladder.ts` (L1–L7) · `tests/workflowEvals.test.ts` · `evals/creditEval.ts` |
| 4 | **Record** | append-only store keyed by `(commit + worktree, case, ts)` with per-check booleans + trace ref | `evals/evalStore.ts` → `docs/eval/eval-runs.jsonl` |
| 5 | **Gate** | cross-version diff names the degraded case **and the exact check that broke** | `npm run eval:diff` (exit 1 on regression) |
| 6 | **Handoff** | the failing trace + ranked recommendations become a Codex / Claude Code packet | [`docs/WHY_NODEAGENT_AND_HALO.md`](docs/WHY_NODEAGENT_AND_HALO.md) handoff contract |
| 7 | **Fix** | the smallest necessary workflow/harness change lands; previews refresh if user interaction changed; the loop re-gates | `npm run workflow:previews:all` Â· back to stage 1 |

The repo-owned runner is:

```bash
npm run agent:improve              # deterministic workflow + ladder evidence
npm run halo:self-improve:smoke    # N=5 path fingerprints + context quality
npm run halo:variant:select        # score competing harness variants and write selectedParent
npm run halo:convex-context:smoke  # mirror Convex job context into HALO metrics
npm run halo:live-path:calibrate   # N=5 real-provider path calibration
npm run agent:improve -- --live    # add provider parser, free route discovery, Convex /free smoke
npm run agent:improve -- --full-live
npm run agent:improve -- --ui-media=docs/eval/ui-recordings/<recording-or-screenshot>
```

The self-improvement smoke is the HyperAgents-inspired part of HALO, kept at a
safe altitude: it does not execute model-generated code. It repeats two
deterministic runtime cases five times each, fingerprints the tool path, checks
assistant/tool-result pairing, records p95 model/tool calls, and measures context
compaction savings. The checked artifact
[`docs/eval/halo-self-improvement-smoke.json`](docs/eval/halo-self-improvement-smoke.json)
currently records 2 cases / 10 runs, one fingerprint per case, zero missing tool
results, 25 compaction events, 21,600 saved chars, and three meta-improvement
proposals. HALO now also runs the HyperAgents-style selection step at a safe
altitude: [`halo-variant-selection.json`](docs/eval/halo-variant-selection.json)
scores competing harness variants and writes `selectedParent`; the current parent
is `runtime-managed-lock-v1` because it removes model-visible lock/unlock calls
while preserving runtime lock/CAS evidence. [`halo-convex-context-telemetry.json`](docs/eval/halo-convex-context-telemetry.json)
mirrors real Convex `agentJobs.detail` data into the same context metric shape.
[`halo-live-path-calibration.json`](docs/eval/halo-live-path-calibration.json)
records the live N=5 provider calibration: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, 5 runs,
2 accepted fingerprints, p95 3 tool calls, p95 4 model calls.

Run the whole loop continuously until a clock deadline. Deterministic-only is the default safe overnight
shape; full-live adds provider spend, the current benchmark contract, and the free-auto router ladder:

```bash
npm run halo:overnight -- --skip-e2e --skip-live --until "2026-06-09T17:00:00Z" --sleep-minutes 25
npm run halo:overnight -- --full-live --ui-media=docs/eval/ui-recordings/live-ui-walkthrough-20260608.mp4 --until "2026-06-09T17:00:00Z" --sleep-minutes 30
npm run halo:supervise -- -Until "2026-06-10T17:00:00Z" -PollSeconds 300
npm run halo:status -- --strict --require-supervisor
npm run halo:status -- --strict --require-supervisor --record
npm run halo:snapshots
```

Each cycle writes `docs/eval/halo-runs/<runId>/status.json` (live state) and `summary.jsonl` (every step of every cycle).
The runner also maintains `docs/eval/halo-runs/.active-run.json`; a second runner exits before writing
run artifacts while a live lock points at an active process.
The supervisor waits behind the active lock, then starts the next deterministic
loop through the handoff deadline, so a long full-live run can finish without a
duplicate writer and coverage still continues afterward.
The Windows cron wrapper checks for an existing supervisor before launch, so
scheduled fires do not create short-lived duplicate supervisors.
The strict status command is the handoff guard: it reports lock age, deadline,
latest events, router-ladder artifact state, active process tree, and supervisor
liveness, and exits nonzero if coverage is missing or duplicated.
Add `--record` to append the same report to
`docs/eval/halo-runs/status-snapshots.jsonl` for the handoff trail.
`npm run halo:snapshots` renders the JSONL trail to
`docs/eval/halo-runs/status-snapshots.md`.
Current overnight run notes: [`docs/eval/HALO_OVERNIGHT_RUN.md`](docs/eval/HALO_OVERNIGHT_RUN.md).

[`docs/WHY_NODEAGENT_AND_HALO.md`](docs/WHY_NODEAGENT_AND_HALO.md).
Architecture ownership/budget gate: `npm run architecture:budget -- --strict`.

Official benchmark posture: `npm run benchmark:official:readiness` is a reporting gate, and
`npm run benchmark:official:readiness -- --strict` remains red until at least one official runner
can execute, export, reopen, and score benchmark work products without hidden-gold access.
SpreadsheetBench V1/V2 now has a local official-bundle ingest adapter (`npm run
benchmark:spreadsheetbench:ingest`) that separates agent-visible workbooks/prompts from
evaluator-only golden files and scorer metadata, a staging adapter (`npm run
benchmark:spreadsheetbench:stage`) that writes separate `agent/` and `evaluator/` manifests, and a
baseline runner (`npm run benchmark:spreadsheetbench:run`) that emits candidate workbooks from the
staged `agent/` directory before opening the evaluator manifest. A local workbook scoring adapter
(`npm run benchmark:spreadsheetbench:score`) then reopens candidate/golden workbooks and compares
values, formulas, optional cell style fingerprints, answer-range column/row layout, and merge
ranges. Smoke artifacts cover the V1 verified-400 bundle and the V2 public example bundle. The
runner also supports `--mode apply-agent-patch`, which reads
`agent/edit-plan.json`, applies cell-level value/formula/style edits, emits a candidate workbook,
then opens evaluator metadata for scoring; the checked-in edit-plan smoke records a passing
candidate and a zero-mismatch score. It also supports `--mode model-edit-plan --model <route>`,
which snapshots only the staged `agent/` workbook/prompts, asks the configured model for a JSON
edit plan, applies it, records token/cost usage, emits a candidate workbook, then scores afterward.
The checked-in live smoke (`docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-model-edit-plan-live-smoke.json`) passed one
staged task with `gpt-5.4-nano` and recorded trajectory, timing, and cost. These artifacts prove
ingest, sandbox-staging, candidate-output, edit/export/reopen, model-planning, and diff plumbing.
The official V1 smoke (`docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-v1-model-edit-plan-live-smoke.json`) deliberately
showed the next harder truth: a model can choose the wrong spreadsheet path on a real staged task,
and the harness must record model call, tokens, cost, trajectory, parser repair, and score evidence
instead of summarizing it away. The N=5 live smoke
(`docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-v1-model-edit-plan-n5-live-smoke.json`) now repeats that official task
five times and records `taskCount: 5`, `caseCount: 1`, `passRate: 1`, p95 latency 4.593s,
`providerCostUsd: 0.01059125`, zero failure counts, and average overall `1`. The harness improvement
is visible in the artifacts: the planner sees agent-visible `aggregate_section` candidates for
section-level table grouping, unsupported invented operations are dropped, section rewrites apply
after scalar cell edits, and the scorer only enforces formula equality when the evaluator gold cell
actually contains a formula. A broader official V1 three-task stability smoke
(`docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-v1-model-edit-plan-3task-n5-live-smoke.json`) now repeats all three
locally staged official tasks five times each: `taskCount: 15`, `caseCount: 3`, `repeatCount: 5`,
`passRate: 1`, average overall `1`, p95 latency 5.080s, `$0.0462905` spend, zero failure counts,
zero retry attempts, and 0 candidate-output leaks across 75 checked files
(`docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-v1-run-3task-n5-contamination-smoke.json`). `npm run
benchmark:spreadsheetbench:proof` now enforces those run metrics, leak bounds, result-level
sidecar hashes for candidate manifests, agent-workspace manifests, generated edit plans, raw model
outputs, and candidate-before-evaluator trajectory order. HALO runs that proof gate on every
`agent:improve`. That run exercises the next two spreadsheet-harness lessons
repeatedly under live model variance: deterministic structural operators for visible date filters
(`filter_rows`) and visible duplicate-removal/sort tables (`sort_unique_rows`) belong in the harness
tool contract, not as fragile one-cell dynamic formulas or short prefix writes. `npm run
benchmark:spreadsheetbench:routes` now classifies staged SpreadsheetBench V1/V2 tasks into
deterministic table transforms, model-planned formula edits, model-planned format/general edits, or
chart-visual work using only agent-visible manifests; the checked-in V1 report classifies
400 tasks as 41 deterministic table transforms, 218 formula edits, 33 format edits, and 108 general
edits with `blocked_chart_visual=0`. The full V1 copy-input baseline also has a chunked runner
(`npm run benchmark:spreadsheetbench:run-chunked`) that records all 400 staged tasks instead of
letting one pathological workbook abort the run: the checked-in report
(`docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-v1-copy-input-full-smoke.json`) records 400/400 attempted tasks,
15/400 pass, average overall `0.257472`, and zero failure counts after malformed answer-position,
unsupported XLSX package-part, and external-link cell-read repair. This is a benchmark-path lesson, not a broad
official-readiness claim: larger held-out model/route-execution runs and official scoring parity are
still tracked as blockers below.
The contamination gate
(`npm run benchmark:contamination`) now scans agent-facing benchmark manifests, candidate manifests,
agent-workspace manifests, and generated edit plans for evaluator-only gold/rubric/canary metadata; checked-in smokes show 0
leaks for the staged V1 root, the full verified-400 V1 stage (`400/400` tasks,
800 agent-facing files, 400 evaluator gold files, 0 leaks across 800 checked
files), the V2 public-example stage (3 paired input/gold tasks from 26 example
tasks with clean isolation), the N=5 one-task V1 candidate output, the
three-task N=5 V1 candidate output, the retry V1 candidate output, and the
staged BTB fixture. The runner also has an explicit retry policy: `--retry-failed N` retries
candidate-generation or scoring errors, `--retry-score-failures` opts into retrying
scored-but-wrong candidates, and the report records case-level attempts, retry exhaustion,
pass-after-retry counts, p95 latency, tokens, and provider cost. The checked-in retry smoke
(`docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-v1-model-edit-plan-retry-live-smoke.json`) ran one official V1 task
with `gpt-5.4-nano`, `--retry-failed 2`, and `--retry-score-failures`: all 3 attempts reached
scoring, each attempt created an agent-only workspace manifest before candidate generation, each
attempt saw the full 302-cell official workbook snapshot, simple `SUM(...)` formulas get cached
results on export/reopen, best overall was `0.616667`, p95 latency was 11.033s, spend was
`$0.0095201`, and pass remained 0/3. That proves retry accounting, attempt-local workspace
boundaries, fuller context capture, formula-result packaging, and leakage scanning while still
surfacing the planner gap honestly. `npm run benchmark:agent-sandbox` now adds a local Node
permission subprocess proof: an agent process can read its copied `agent-workspace/` file and is
denied evaluator-only gold outside that root. This tightens the file-boundary story, but it is not
Docker/Harbor isolation, network isolation, or a resource sandbox, and these artifacts are not
official benchmark scores until run across official bundles under the benchmark policy. `npm run
benchmark:docker-sandbox:probe` records that stronger boundary separately in
`docs/eval/docker-sandbox-probe.json`; the current checked-in artifact records
`container_isolation_proven` on Docker `28.5.1` with `node:22-alpine`, `--network=none`,
`--read-only`, an agent-workspace-only mount, and denied evaluator reads. That closes the local
Docker tool blocker; official readiness still stays red until the benchmark runners themselves are
executed under the full official policy.

The deterministic formula-result lane has since moved beyond `SUM(...)`: `apply-agent-patch` and
`model-edit-plan` candidate manifests now record `formulaResultPolicy:
deterministic_local_subset`, covering arithmetic, same-sheet cell refs/ranges,
`SUM`/`AVERAGE`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`COUNT`/`COUNTA`, `ABS`,
`ROUND`/`ROUNDUP`/`ROUNDDOWN`, `IF`/`IFERROR`, single-criteria
`SUMIF`/`COUNTIF`/`AVERAGEIF`, and multi-criteria
`SUMIFS`/`COUNTIFS`/`AVERAGEIFS`, plus exact
`MATCH`/`INDEX`/`VLOOKUP`/`XLOOKUP`, `SUMPRODUCT`, text extraction/search
(`LEFT`/`RIGHT`/`MID`/`LEN`/`FIND`/`SEARCH`/`REPLACE`), `TEXT`/`DATE`, `VALUE`,
`CONCATENATE`, and `TRIM` before export/reopen scoring, including basic wildcard
criteria. That is useful for SpreadsheetBench smokes, but still not a complete
Excel calculation engine; approximate lookup, array formulas, volatile
functions, external refs, and dynamic Excel functions remain outside the local
deterministic subset.

SpreadsheetBench format evidence now goes beyond individual cell style hashes when
`--compare-styles` is enabled: the scorer also checks answer-range column widths/hidden state,
row heights/hidden state, and merge ranges that intersect the answer region. That makes layout
drift visible in workbook score reports without widening access to evaluator-only gold before
candidate emission. It still is not the official benchmark's complete formatting policy, and it
does not replace rendered chart/layout grading.

SpreadsheetBench V2 chart evidence now has two lanes:
`src/eval/spreadsheetBenchChartScorer.ts` compares candidate and golden `.xlsx` chart packages by
normalizing and hashing `xl/charts/*.xml` plus `xl/drawings/*.xml`, then reports matched, missing,
extra, and mismatched chart parts. The workbook scorer and staged runner can carry that evidence in
score reports, so V2 chart-package drift is no longer invisible. The rendered lane is now live too:
`npm run benchmark:spreadsheetbench:chart-visual:grade` exports a real SpreadsheetBench V2
Visualization chart sheet through Excel, rasterizes it with Poppler, and asks Gemini 3.5 Flash to
accept the matching oracle candidate while rejecting the raw-input negative control. The resulting
`docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-chart-visual/task-126/vlm-report.json` is consumed by
`npm run benchmark:spreadsheetbench:chart-visual:probe -- --strict`, whose current checked-in
artifact is `chart_visual_grade_proven` with renderer, candidate/gold PNG hashes, dimensions, and an
accepted VLM report. The refreshed V2 score/run smokes still show the static signal explicitly:
copy-input candidates miss two evaluator-only chart/drawing package parts per sampled task, dropping
runner best-overall scores from workbook-only near-passes to chart-aware failures while the V2
staged/run contamination smokes stay at 0 leaks.

BankerToolBench now has the same first boundary in place: `npm run
benchmark:bankertoolbench:ingest` scans an already-downloaded BTB bundle (`tasks.jsonl`,
`task-data/`, optional `golden-outputs/`) and parses input files plus weighted rubric metadata
without putting rubric, canary, or golden-output paths into the agent-facing task payload. `npm run
benchmark:bankertoolbench:stage` writes separate `agent/` and `evaluator/` manifests; the agent
side contains only the official default `final_prompt` plus input files, while the evaluator side
holds prompt context, formatting context, canary, weighted rubric, and golden outputs. Checked-in
smoke artifacts and the contamination gate prove that boundary on a local BTB-shaped fixture.
`npm run benchmark:bankertoolbench:run` now adds the next boundary: it copies each attempt into an
agent-only workspace, emits candidate deliverables before opening evaluator-only rubric/golden
metadata, validates the exact expected output package shape for supported spreadsheet, deck,
document, PDF, CSV, and image deliverables, records a trajectory, and runs a local exact-package /
exact-or-workbook-semantic weighted-rubric smoke verifier. Excel deliverables now get reopened and
scored with the workbook scorer, so a semantically identical `.xlsx` can pass even when package
metadata changes the file hash. The checked-in run smoke is deliberately 0/6 because copy-input is
not a solution, but it proves the runner/verifier handoff, multi-file package accounting, workbook
semantic scoring, and 0-leak artifact path. A second checked-in `apply-agent-output` smoke proves
the positive path: agent-authored deliverables score 6/6 weighted points, pass 1/1, and keep
candidate emission before evaluator access with 0 leaks across 4 checked files. `npm run
benchmark:bankertoolbench:proof` now enforces both local BTB harness boundaries in HALO: staged
isolation, candidate-before-evaluator trajectory, negative baseline accounting, positive
weighted-rubric/package scoring, supported deliverable policy, and 0-leak artifacts. This is
still not a BTB score: Harbor/Docker process isolation, MCP financial tools, and Gandalf verifier
replay remain red gates. `npm run benchmark:bankertoolbench:manifest-lock` now hashes a BTB bundle's
`tasks.jsonl`, `task-data/**`, and `golden-outputs/**` into a provenance lockfile; the checked-in
fixture smoke is `docs/eval/bankertoolbench-manifest-lock-smoke.json`. `npm run
benchmark:bankertoolbench:official-contract` makes the full external contract explicit in
`docs/eval/bankertoolbench-official-contract.json`: dataset revision and manifest-lock hashes,
Harbor/Docker mount policy, required SEC/market-data/logo/document/web MCP tools, and the Gandalf
score-import schema. The Docker availability probe makes the process-isolation blocker executable
instead of hand-wavy: it must pass with `container_isolation_proven` before any public BTB readiness
claim can move out of red.

## Benchmark Harness / v3 Composite-Synthesis Run

The agent is model-agnostic (one `AgentModel` seam), so the diligence-research task can run across
providers and the cheapest model that clears the **boolean gate** wins. Providers are routed by
**NodeBench's `modelCatalog.ts`** (copied verbatim — reuse, not reinvent), reaching cheap + free
models through OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The checked-in `docs/eval/results.json`
is the latest verified run of the listed routes, not proof that all models and all scenarios were
rerun.

**The charts are downstream of a real run — never hand-drawn.** `npm run benchmark` writes
`docs/eval/results.json` (real $/latency/tokens from `agentRuns`, real pass% from deterministic
checks); `npm run benchmark:charts` renders these SVGs from it. Reproduce it yourself.

**Why v3 exists (an honest history).** Two earlier benchmark generations were invalidated on
review and are not comparable to v3: the v1 low-level runs executed with a broken fetch path
(every `fetch_source` failed, so two checks measured the network, not the model), and the v2
single-call composite let a deterministic harness template author the row fields — every check
graded our own code, and a content-free "no claim asserted" template passed `NO_FABRICATION`
vacuously. v3 (`company-research-v3-composite-synthesis`) splits the workflow so each layer is
measured for what it owns: a **fetch preflight** aborts before any model spend if the environment
cannot fetch; `fetch_row_sources` (harness) locks the row and returns fenced source snippets;
**the model synthesizes the four research fields in its own words**; `write_row` (harness)
validates with zod and does the CAS writes, citations, freshness, status, and lock release. A
**content floor** in `STRUCTURED_FIELDS` rejects both disclaimer-shaped non-answers and
from-memory text with no derivation from the fetched evidence, and the LLM judge grades the
model-authored summaries against the actual fetched snippets.

Latest verified v3 run (2026-06-11 OpenRouter cheap/free catalog smoke, 1 company,
route snapshot `fabbcd520e971ec7`, per-row trace refs in `docs/eval/traces/benchmark/`):

| Route | Gate | Cost/run | Time | What the gate saw |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `nex-agi/nex-n2-pro:free` | **9/9** | $0.0000 | 6.2s | Fastest free route that completed the current smoke. |
| `ibm-granite/granite-4.1-8b` | **9/9** | $0.0009 | 6.3s | Cheapest paid route that completed the current smoke. |
| `z-ai/glm-4.7-flash` | **9/9** | $0.0013 | 17.5s | Low-cost paid route with successful sourced synthesis. |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | **9/9** | $0.0020 | 38.7s | Prior 3-company champion still clears the cheaper smoke. |

The run attempted 28 current cheap/free or very low-cost OpenRouter routes; 18 cleared 9/9 and 10
were recorded as provider, harness, or model failures instead of being hidden. This is promotion
evidence for the background research workflow only; collaboration routing still uses the
lock/CAS/draft ladder.
Run `npm run benchmark` or `npm run benchmark:free` to refresh it.

The broader supported-model bakeoff is tracked separately in
[`docs/eval/MODEL_EVAL_MATRIX.md`](docs/eval/MODEL_EVAL_MATRIX.md). Dry-run the
whole route/scenario plan with `npm run eval:model-matrix -- --json-out
docs/eval/model-eval-matrix-plan.json`; run it live with
`npm run eval:model-matrix:live` when you intentionally want the full
OpenRouter/native route spend. That matrix covers the v3 research task plus
L1-L4 collaboration scenarios, so a model cannot be promoted from research
quality alone.

fetched-not-invented · in-budget) + 2 **LLM-judge** (`NO_FABRICATION`, `RIGHT_ENTITY`, judged by
`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, calibrated to flag only invented *specifics* — synthesis is the product,
not hallucination, per `grounded_eval`):

| model | provider | checks | $/run | latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` | Google | **6/6 ✓** | **$0.0076** | 10 s |
| `gpt-5.4-nano` | OpenAI | 6/6 ✓ | $0.0130 | 60 s |
| `gpt-5.4-mini` | OpenAI | 6/6 ✓ | $0.0151 | 15 s |
| `claude-haiku-4-5` | Anthropic | 6/6 ✓ | $0.1201 | 34 s |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Anthropic | 6/6 ✓ | $0.1789 | 44 s |
| `gemini-3.5-flash` | Google | 5/6 ✗fabrication | $0.2339 | 58 s |

**Legacy routing call (pre-v2 benchmark):** `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` wins outright — **cheapest
($0.0076), fastest (10 s), 6/6**. The *priciest* model, `gemini-3.5-flash` ($0.2339), is the
**only one that fabricated a specific** not in its sources — dominated on both axes. More expensive
≠ better; route to the cheapest that clears the gate. (That's the LLM-judge earning its place — the
4 deterministic checks alone scored everyone 6/6.)

**Honest caveat (first-principles):** the research run above is a *floor* task — summarize
well-documented companies — so quality is near-saturated (5 of 6 perfect) and **cost dominates**.
A quality-*spread* benchmark needs the **task ladder** below.

### Task ladder - where models actually diverge

`npm run ladder:real` runs each model up a complexity ladder (the spec's keystone): read,
edit, conflict-recovery, blocked-must-draft, large range, and long-horizon recovery. It prints
a failure heatmap that a single-task chart cannot show (`evals/ladder.ts`):

```
model                     L1  L2  L3  L4  L5  L6
scripted                  ok  ok  ok  ok  ok  ok
<real model>              ok  ok  ok  no  ... ...
```

L1 read-only; L2 single CAS edit; L3 concurrent-edit no-clobber; L4 locked-range must-draft;
L5 large-sheet range discipline; L6 compaction plus repeated conflict recovery.

**The finding the flat benchmark hid:** `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` *won* the research benchmark
outright (cheapest, fastest, 6/6), but it **fails L4**: when another agent holds the lock it
doesn't draft, it forces. So the routing call is
*task-dependent*: cheapest model for solo work, a collaboration-safe model once edits contend.
That safety tradeoff is invisible on a cost-quality chart and obvious on the ladder. **A good
model isn't the smartest-sounding one; it's the cheapest that safely completes the hardest level
without corrupting shared state.**

The **notebook / cross-collaboration / risk-attack** harnesses are the sequenced next milestones;
the full task-ladder spec is in [`docs/AUDIT.md`](docs/AUDIT.md).

**Diagnosis wins (analyst, not guesswork — each found by the `probe.ts`, then fixed):**
- **Gemini 3.x thinking models** (`gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`) first failed —
  *"function call missing a thought_signature"*. They require their `thought_signature`
  round-tripped across tool turns; the harness now preserves provider metadata per tool call
  (`ToolCall.providerMetadata` → replayed in `toSdkMessages`). 2.5-class models don't need it.
- **`claude-*` 404'd locally** with a valid key → a stale shell `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` missing
  `/v1`; the runner now loads `.env.local` first (`loadEnv.ts`) so providers capture the right URL.
- Earlier: AI-SDK **version skew** (pinned providers to v2), OpenRouter **Responses→`.chat()`**,
  OpenRouter **lazy key** capture.

**Still open (documented, not hidden):**
- **`gpt-5.5`** (flagship *reasoning* model) hits the OpenAI-Responses-API analog of the Gemini
  issue — a `function_call` needs its reasoning item round-tripped. The metadata round-trip needs
  extending to OpenAI's reasoning path; the **GPT-5.4 tier works clean**.
- **OpenRouter free tier** is task-dependent. It is useful for explicit `/free`
  and budgeted background experiments, but the current v3 GTM research
  benchmark keeps it at 7/9 because it fails the content floor, and the live
  L1-L4 lock/CAS/draft ladder times out or fails on blocked-range behavior. Do
  not promote it as the default shared-room editor.

Model ids are **discovery-verified** (parallel subagents + a live probe corrected
`claude-*.5`→`claude-*-5`, dropped shut-down `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, added
`gemini-3.5-flash` / `gpt-5.5`). `modelCatalog.ts` is the single source of truth.
