/**
 * Data-retention pruning (production gate: telemetry does not grow unbounded).
 *
 * The high-volume, append-only telemetry tables (traces, agentSteps, agentOperationEvents) grow
 * every cycle of every run with no natural ceiling — on a live deployment that compounds nightly.
 * This prunes rows older than RETENTION_DAYS using Convex's built-in `by_creation_time` system index
 * (a global, age-ordered scan), in a BOUNDED batch per table per run so a single mutation never
 * exceeds Convex's write limits. The cron fires every 6h; a backlog drains over several runs.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT pruned: product data (artifacts/elements/drafts/proposals), chat `messages`, and
 * `agentRuns` (the spend ledger the daily cap reads). This bounds storage growth without deleting
 * anything a user or a gate still depends on.
