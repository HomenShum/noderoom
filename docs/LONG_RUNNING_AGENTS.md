# Long-Running Agent Jobs

This is the interview-ready story for long-running NodeRoom jobs in a Convex environment.

## Constraint

Convex actions are the right place for provider calls because they can make network calls, but they have a hard action execution limit of 10 minutes. Actions also have side effects, so Convex cannot automatically retry them safely after errors. Official references:

- Actions: https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions
- Limits: https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits
- Workflows: https://docs.convex.dev/agents/workflows

## What NodeRoom Does Now

The live agent action (`convex/agent.ts`) runs inside that 10-minute window with an explicit reserve:

```text
deadlineAt = action start + AGENT_ACTION_BUDGET_MS
reserveMs  = AGENT_ACTION_RESERVE_MS
```

The runtime (`src/nodeagent/core/runtime.ts`) checks the deadline before each model turn and before tool execution. If there is not enough usable time left, it returns a resumable `handoff` instead of pushing the action into Convex's hard timeout.

Deployment note:

```text
Convex action module -> standard action runtime
  -> src/nodeagent/models/convexModel.ts direct provider HTTP adapter
  -> same AgentModel interface as local evals
```

The local eval/provider-parser path can still use the Vercel AI SDK. Convex function modules avoid that dependency boundary so `npx convex codegen` exercises the same deploy analyzer path that production uses.

Persisted run telemetry now records:

```text
stopReason: done | step_budget | time_budget | error
remainingMs
deadlineAt
handoff
```

The handoff is also written as a trace event (`tool: "handoff"`), so it participates in the same append-only, hash-chained `agentSteps` audit path as normal tool calls.

Current direction: `/ask` is no longer a separate persistence path. Every
durable public or Room-lane request creates or reuses an `agentJobs` row first,
then runs the first slice immediately. Private read-only advise is still a
one-call private reply path and does not create a job. If a durable slice
exhausts its step/time budget, it checkpoints cursor state and starts the same
Workflow/Workpool continuation path. The current ledger records bounded
job-level and aggregate slice events; per-query and per-mutation operation rows
remain the target contract. `/free` remains only the explicit slow/free model
policy.
See
[`docs/NODEAGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`](NODEAGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Free-Auto Model Policy

NodeRoom also has an explicit free-auto command for demos and low-cost
background work:

```text
/free <goal>
  -> agentJobs.startFreeAuto mutation
  -> durable agentJobs row
  -> @convex-dev/workflow freeAutoWorkflow
  -> Workpool-limited internal action agentJobRunner.runFreeAutoJobSlice
  -> runAgent with modelPolicy=openrouter/free-auto
  -> checkpoint or complete
  -> workflow sleep/resume when work remains
```

This is not a second agent architecture. It is a command that starts the same
durable job contract with `modelPolicy=openrouter/free-auto`. Normal `/ask`
also can continue beyond 10 minutes now: if the first action slice cannot
finish, it writes a checkpoint and starts Workflow continuation with the job's
selected model policy.

Durable tables:

```text
agentJobs
  roomId, artifactId, goal, status
  modelPolicy = AGENT_MODEL for /ask, openrouter/free-auto for /free
  runtime = workflow
  workflowId, workId
  cursor, handoff
  attempts, maxAttempts
  leaseId, leaseUntil
  nextRunAt, latestRunId

agentJobAttempts
  jobId, runId, attempt
  resolvedModel, stopReason
  ms, tokens, cost
  error, scheduledNextAt
```

Runtime knobs:

```text
FREE_AUTO_JOB_MODEL=openrouter/free-auto
FREE_AUTO_JOB_SLICE_BUDGET_MS=540000
FREE_AUTO_JOB_RESERVE_MS=30000
FREE_AUTO_JOB_MAX_STEPS_PER_SLICE=3
FREE_AUTO_JOB_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS=24000
FREE_AUTO_JOB_CONTEXT_KEEP_RECENT=10
```

`FREE_AUTO_JOB_MODEL` only overrides jobs whose saved policy is
`openrouter/free-auto`. A handed-off `/ask` job keeps the model policy selected
for the interactive slice, so Workflow continuation does not silently switch a
Gemini/OpenAI/Claude run into the free-auto lane.

Default cap math:

```text
Convex hard action cap       = 10 minutes
default slice budget         = 9 minutes
default reserve              = 30 seconds
default lease extra          = 60 seconds
default model-call handoff   = before usable time reaches zero
```

At the defaults, a slice voluntarily hands off around 8.5 minutes and has a
full persistence margin before Convex's hard cap. That is the correct product
claim: NodeRoom does not beat the 10-minute limit; it leaves margin, writes a
checkpoint, and lets Workflow sleep/resume the next slice. The remaining
hardening is to clamp misconfigured budgets so they cannot erase that margin.

Lease behavior:

```text
claimSlice(jobId, leaseId)
  - refuses terminal jobs
  - refuses currently leased running jobs
  - increments attempt
  - records leaseUntil

finishSlice(...)
  - records agentJobAttempts
  - updates job status
  - stores cursor/handoff
  - releases lease
  - stores nextRunAt for workflow-runtime jobs
  - only schedules a next slice directly for legacy scheduler-runtime jobs
```

The cursor stores compacted `AgentMessage[]` plus any `remainingToolCalls` from a mid-turn handoff. On the next slice, `runAgent` resumes from those messages instead of rebuilding the task from scratch.

Job controls:

```text
cancel(jobId)
  - terminal state = cancelled
  - clears lease so a still-running slice cannot overwrite the user's cancel

retry(jobId)
  - moves failed/blocked/cancelled/paused jobs back to queued
  - extends maxAttempts without erasing prior attempt history
  - starts a fresh workflow id
```

Workflow/Workpool behavior:

```text
freeAutoWorkflow
  - polls agentJobs.workflowState
  - sleeps until nextRunAt without consuming action runtime
  - runs one bounded action slice per workflow step
  - disables provider-call retries at the Workpool layer because each slice owns
    its own retry/attempt accounting and provider calls must not double-bill
```

## Durable Provider-Step Journal

Workflow retry alone is not enough for provider calls. The expensive failure
case is:

```text
slice starts
  -> calls provider
  -> provider returns a valid model step
  -> process crashes before the job checkpoint mutation
  -> retry starts from the old cursor
  -> without a journal, the retry calls and bills the provider again
```

NodeRoom closes that gap at the model-step boundary:

```text
runAgent step N
  -> journal.get(jobId, sliceKey, N)
  -> if found: replay AgentStep, do not call provider, do not count new tokens
  -> if missing: call provider
  -> immediately journal.record(jobId, sliceKey, N, AgentStep)
  -> execute tool calls
  -> checkpoint cursor/handoff at slice end
```

The durable table is `agentModelStepJournal`, indexed by
`(jobId, sliceKey, step)`. The `sliceKey` is intentionally not the attempt
number. Attempts increment on retries; the slice key is derived from the
semantic slice input:

- `/ask`: job id, artifact id/version, goal, mode, model policy, and step cap.
- Workflow continuation: job id, artifact id, goal, mode, model policy, cursor,
  handoff, and step cap.

That means a retry before checkpoint sees the same key and replays the model
step, while a successful checkpoint writes a new cursor and naturally starts a
new slice journal. Tools may re-execute on replay, which is acceptable because
writes are still guarded by locks, CAS baselines, and mutation receipts.

Honest boundary: if the process dies before the provider response is received
or before `journal.record` commits, there is no completed result to replay. The
next retry may call the provider again. Where providers expose request
idempotency keys, those can be added as a further adapter-level optimization,
but the durable journal solves the common crash-after-response/before-checkpoint
double-bill case.

## Remaining Hardening

The durable shape is built: `agentJobs`, `agentJobAttempts`,
idempotent `createOrReuse` / `startFreeAuto`, `freeAutoWorkflow`,
Workpool-limited slices, leases, cursor/handoff resume, cancel/retry,
resolved-model attempt telemetry, and durable provider-step journaling. What
remains is the reliability layer that turns it from a
demo-compatible background path into a production worker:

| Gap | Why it matters | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| Stricter budget clamps | Defaults leave margin, but env overrides can shrink the reserve too far. | Cap slice budgets below the platform limit and enforce a larger reserve floor. |
| Per-tool abort propagation | The runtime checks time before each tool, and model calls are abortable, but a slow tool started near the deadline can still run to completion. | Thread a deadline `AbortSignal` into tools and long I/O helpers. |
| Provider idempotency keys | The durable journal replays after a response is recorded, but cannot replay a response that never committed. | Add provider request idempotency keys where supported and store provider request ids on journal rows. |
| Model health and quarantine | Static free-model ranking plus fallback is not the same as production routing. | Track latency, timeouts, failures, rate limits, fallback count, and quarantine windows. |
| Failure-path model provenance | A successful call records the concrete resolved model, but an all-candidates-failed path can still report the alias. | Store attempted models and final attempted model on each attempt. |
| Real job-runner tests | Current deterministic coverage proves the shape, and live smoke covers `/ask` handoff; deeper crash injection still needs dedicated fixtures. | Add forced multi-slice Convex tests for resume, stale leases, crash-after-provider-call replay, retry backoff, and duplicate enqueue. |

## Context Management

Long runs do not keep appending full stale reads forever. The runtime accepts compaction options, and the Convex action enables them by default:

```text
AGENT_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS=24000
AGENT_CONTEXT_KEEP_RECENT=10
```

Compaction keeps the task, recent turns, and message envelopes intact while eliding old bulky `read_range` results. That preserves provider tool-call history without letting context size drift.

## Evaluation Pattern

The ladder runner supports per-rung runtime budgets:

```bash
npm run ladder:real -- openrouter/free-auto --rung-timeout-ms=540000 --reserve-ms=30000
```

That makes "does the model finish safely inside the operational budget?" part of the eval, not a subjective demo judgment. The `openrouter/free-auto` result is recorded in `docs/eval/free-auto-ladder.md`: L1-L3 were functionally correct but slow; L4 did not finish in the run budget. That is why free-auto remains opt-in and the live collaboration default is a faster ladder-proven model.

Verification commands:

```bash
npm run typecheck -- --pretty false
npx tsc --noEmit --project convex\tsconfig.json --pretty false
npx convex codegen --dry-run --typecheck disable
npm test
npm run ladder
npm run free-job:smoke
npm run liteparse:smoke
```

`npm run free-job:smoke` is optional because it needs real deployment env:

```text
CONVEX_URL or VITE_CONVEX_URL
FREE_JOB_ROOM_ID
FREE_JOB_ARTIFACT_ID
FREE_JOB_ACTOR_ID
FREE_JOB_ACTOR_TOKEN
```

Live deployment smoke (2026-06-08):

```text
dev deployment: zealous-goshawk-766
goal: say "free job smoke complete" and stop
result: completed
attempts: 1/1
resolvedModel: nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free
stopReason: done
latency: 10055ms
```

This proves the deployed Workflow/Workpool path can run with a real provider.
It does not prove live multi-slice resume because this smoke completed in one
attempt. The next live proof should force tiny slice budgets and assert resume,
lease, attempt, resolved-model, and final artifact state across multiple slices.

The first run failed with a provider 401 because `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` was not set in
the Convex dev environment. After setting that env var, the same live path completed.

The regression test `resumes a long-running job across multiple step-budget slices` in `tests/agentRuntime.test.ts` forces a read -> checkpoint -> edit -> checkpoint -> final answer sequence with a fresh model instance per slice.

## Production Pattern

For short interactive collaboration, one action can use the full 10-minute envelope with a reserve and handoff. For durable production jobs such as multi-document parsing, bulk enrichment, or ERP reconciliation, split the work:

```text
user intent mutation
  -> durable job row / artifact cursor
  -> workflow/workpool step
  -> idempotent unit of work
  -> checkpoint result + trace
  -> schedule next unit or complete
```

Convex Workflows / Workpool are the production direction when the job must survive server restarts, retry individual steps, limit concurrency, and resume from recorded state. NodeRoom's handoff object is intentionally shaped like a workflow checkpoint: it carries the original goal, pending tool calls, message count, trace count, latest assistant text, and budget reason.

## LiveFlow Carryover

The same pattern applies to Flow ERP-style agents:

- Do not make one giant unrecoverable agent call.
- Persist user intent before side effects.
- Chunk work into idempotent steps with cursors.
- Record model, cost, latency, stop reason, and evidence.
- Leave enough runtime reserve to write the audit trail.
- Evaluate with both outcome checks and trajectory checks.

The soundbite:

> We do not try to beat the 10-minute serverless limit. We engineer around it: budget-aware runs, compacted context, durable checkpoints, idempotent steps, and evals that measure whether the agent finishes safely inside the envelope.
