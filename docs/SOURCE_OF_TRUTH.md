# NodeRoom Source Of Truth

One page. If a slide, README, or design note names something this table does not, this table wins.

## Wedge

NodeRoom is the live room where humans and AI agents do startup-banking diligence together: multiple people ask, multiple agents research with cited sources, findings land in a shared sheet, no write silently clobbers another, and every agent change is traceable and reviewable.

## Landed Source Of Truth

`src/nodeagent/**` is the canonical source tree. The old `src/agent/**` tree was removed after the repo import graph moved to NodeAgent, and the previous shared formula/rebase entrypoints were folded into nodeagent-owned modules.

## Vocabulary Reconciliation

Design-intent names now live in `src/nodeagent/**`. Convex remains the durable backend, but frontend code, tests, scripts, and evals should import nodeagent modules directly.

| Design-intent name | Repo reality | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `src/nodeagent/{core,models,skills,guardrails}` namespace | Canonical implementation under `src/nodeagent/**`. | aligned |
| Pi Agent Core / pi-ai runtime | Custom `runAgent` loop in `src/nodeagent/core/runtime.ts` on the AI SDK, run inside Convex `"use node"` actions. | aligned to repo reality |
| Linkup search SDK + `linkupLogs` | `src/nodeagent/skills/search/fetchSource.ts`: SSRF-hardened bounded URL fetch with https-only, private-IP rejection, timeout, byte caps, and egress allowlist. | roadmap dependency; current bounded fetch is live |
| OpenRouter adaptive routing matrix | `AGENT_MODEL`, `AGENT_RESEARCH_MODEL`, model catalog helpers, and OpenRouter free/paid discovery scripts. | simpler than the design notes |
| MCP server exposing `nodeagent_*` tools | None. Tools are guarded by Convex permissions and schemas. | absent; do not build until there is a consumer |
| `.agent/` rules directory | Truth lives in `src/nodeagent/models/prompts/systemPrompt.ts`, `src/nodeagent/skills/spreadsheet/cellMutator.ts`, and `docs/NODEAGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`. | absent; avoid duplicate drift |
| Convex Workflow + Workpool durable jobs | `@convex-dev/workflow` and `@convex-dev/workpool` are wired through Convex config/job files. | built |
| Formula engine | `src/nodeagent/core/formulaEngine.ts`, imported by UI/engine and test-covered. | built and tested |
| Semantic Rebase | `SmartResolver` plus deterministic draft merge path. LLM resolver packet tables remain target-state. | partially built |
| Downstream connectors | `downstreamPublish` prepares Gmail, Notion, Slack, Linear, LinkedIn, and CRM draft artifacts only. | draft handoff; live OAuth is roadmap |

## Strongest Current Claims

- No-clobber wedge: per-cell CAS, locks, proposals, and traces prevent silent overwrites. Evidence: `tests/noClobberWedge.test.ts`, `tests/multiUserCoordinationProof.test.ts`, `convex/artifacts.ts`, `convex/locks.ts`.
- Finance and professional workflows: internal GTM/finance catalog, finance model, SpreadsheetBench-like, BankerToolBench-like, and OpenRouter-on-Convex harness tests are present. These are internal benchmark-faithful gates, not official public scores.
- Company research loop: `companyResearchPlan` and world-model context builders read pending/stale rows, fetch bounded sources, write evidence/review state, and preserve CRM fields.
- Private streaming agent: private replies stream to the requester's lane and persist. Do not claim generalized public token streaming.
- Multi-agent workbench: visible memory-mode demo and judged media exist. Startup diligence now has a two-clip evidence path: live create/join plus scripted synthesis/private/downstream.
- Fresh startup room: live mode now starts a new "Startup Banking Diligence War Room" by default. The `startup-diligence-live-join` walkthrough proves teammate join-by-code; `startup-diligence-war-room` proves the broader diligence workflow.

## Do Not

- Do not recreate legacy agent entrypoints. New agent work belongs under `src/nodeagent/**`; legacy path reintroduction is blocked by import guards.
- Do not bypass Convex as durable backend. NodeAgent owns the agent implementation surface; Convex owns durable jobs, permissions, locks, writes, streams, and audit persistence.
- Do not imply JPM or bank affiliation. Use "startup-banking diligence" or "JPM-style workflow reference" only.
- Do not claim live OAuth connectors until user-authorized adapters exist and pass live tests.
- Do not claim official SpreadsheetBench or BankerToolBench scores until official fixtures, adapters, runs, and scorer outputs are recorded.
- Do not claim full production LiteParse/OCR worker coverage beyond the installed adapter/smoke lane.

## Current Verification Snapshot

2026-06-14, local repo:

- `npm run typecheck -- --pretty false`: pass.
- `npx tsc --noEmit --project convex\tsconfig.json --pretty false`: pass.
- `npm run build`: pass.
- `npm test -- --run`: 88 files, 500 tests pass.
- `npm run content:fluency:check`: pass.

Browser/media evidence:

- Direct Playwright create/join verification renders the Startup Banking Diligence War Room with Mercury/Ramp/Brex research rows, a fresh room code, Maya and Priya in the same room, Priya's chat message, no guided-tour overlay, and Gmail/Notion/Slack/Linear/LinkedIn/CRM handoffs.
- `docs/walkthroughs/startup-diligence-live-join.mp4` shows a host creating a fresh room and a second user joining by code.
- `docs/walkthroughs/startup-diligence-war-room.mp4` shows the scripted research/enrichment, private lane, and downstream draft handoff story.
