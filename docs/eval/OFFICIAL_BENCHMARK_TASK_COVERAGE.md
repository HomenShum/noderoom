# Official Benchmark Task Coverage

Generated: 2026-06-13T21:50:23.370Z

This is the no-shorthand ledger for the external benchmark question: have we staged and run every published task, or only a subset/fixture? It deliberately separates full official tracks, verified subsets, and NodeRoom's internal multi-user conflict suite.

## Summary

- Tracks complete: 1/5
- Declared task targets represented in this ledger: 1738
- Staged tasks: 409
- Deterministic runner tasks: 408
- Model-run cases: 7
- Model-run attempts: 19
- Strict full coverage ready: no

## Policy

- Do not collapse sampled N=5 evidence into a full official benchmark claim.
- A task is staged only when the agent-visible manifest is separated from evaluator gold and scorer metadata.
- A task is model-run only when candidate artifacts are emitted from an agent workspace before evaluator access opens.
- Full official coverage requires every published task for the named benchmark track, not only a verified subset or fixture.
- NodeRoom multi-user conflict tasks are an internal benchmark family; they complement SpreadsheetBench/BankerToolBench but do not replace them.

## Coverage Tracks

| Track | Status | Task Targets | Staged | Deterministic Run | Model Cases / Attempts | Pass Rate | Blockers |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `spreadsheetbench-v1-full-912` | missing | 912 | 0 | 0 | 0 / 0 | n/a | Download/lock the full 912-task SpreadsheetBench V1 bundle.; Stage all 912 tasks with agent/evaluator isolation.; Run all 912 tasks through the model runner or an approved chunked official-policy runner. |
| `spreadsheetbench-v1-verified-400` | partial | 400 | 400 | 400 | 3 / 15 | 1.000 | 397 verified task(s) still need model-run evidence; current N=5 smoke covers 3/400 cases.; Full verified-score promotion still needs official scoring parity, not only local workbook scoring. |
| `spreadsheetbench-v2-full-321` | partial | 321 | 3 | 3 | 3 / 3 | 0.000 | 318 SpreadsheetBench 2 task(s) still need staging from the full official bundle.; Run every staged V2 task through the model runner, static workbook scorer, and rendered/VLM chart grader where applicable. |
| `bankertoolbench-full-100` | partial | 100 | 1 | 0 | 1 / 1 | 1.000 | 99 BankerToolBench task(s) still need staging from the official bundle.; Wire Harbor/MCP/Gandalf verifier replay before claiming an official BTB score. |
| `noderoom-multi-user-conflict` | complete | 5 | 5 | 5 | 0 / 0 | 1.000 | none |
