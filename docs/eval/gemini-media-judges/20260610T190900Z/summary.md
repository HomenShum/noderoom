| `docs/walkthroughs/review-approve.gif` | readme_walkthrough | publish | 8/16 | 0/0/1 | The walkthrough clearly demonstrates the review and approval workflow, showing how turning off auto-allow forces agents to propose changes rather than writing them directly. |
| `docs/walkthroughs/sheet-undo.gif` | readme_walkthrough | publish | 10.8/16 | 0/0/0 | The walkthrough clearly demonstrates the spreadsheet cell editing and undo functionality within NodeRoom. The flow is complete, showing the initial state, edit action, and subsequent reversion via the undo button. |

## Open Defects

- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/app-manual-edit.gif` @ 00:02: The variance value '+20.5%' appears instantly without typing or cursor focus indicators. -> Add a brief hover or focus state to make the manual edit action more natural.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/app-research-enrich.gif` @ 00:02: The video remains static from 00:01 to 00:07 after the enrichment action completes. -> Trim the trailing static frames to reduce the overall GIF file size.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/app-variance-fill.gif` @ 00:01: The trace log text at the bottom is small and dense, making it slightly hard to read on smaller screens. -> Increase the font size of the trace log or provide a zoomed-in view of the log updates.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/ask-spreadsheet-cas.gif` @ 00:01: The transition of spreadsheet cell states happens very rapidly, which may be hard to track on first viewing. -> Slightly increase the delay between agent actions to allow the viewer to digest the cell updates.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/free-job-halo.gif` @ 00:01: Dense UI text and small font sizes in the spreadsheet cells reduce readability at standard preview sizes. -> Slightly increase the zoom level of the application UI during capture.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/l1-read.gif` @ 00:05: The 'say' steps (5/7 and 6/7) do not show the actual text output generated by the AI in the main panel. -> Display the generated text or report summary in the main view during the 'say' steps.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/l2-edit.gif` @ 00:02: The AI action label briefly shows 'say' with no descriptive text. -> Provide descriptive text for step 2/7 or remove the empty placeholder step.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/l2-edit.gif` @ 00:06: The AI action label shows 'say' with no descriptive text before the final step. -> Provide descriptive text for step 6/7 or remove the empty placeholder step.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/l3-no-clobber.gif` @ 00:01: The bottom status bar briefly shows 'say' with no content before moving to the next step. -> Ensure the agent's verbal output or thought process is populated or skip the empty 'say' step.
- **P1** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/l4-draft.gif` @ 00:03: Step 3/5 duplicates the text and action of Step 1/5 ('locks the affected range - read-only for others'). -> Remove the duplicate step or update Step 3/5 to show a unique progression in the workflow.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/l6-long-horizon.gif` @ 00:02: The interface is highly stylized and abstracted, which may not perfectly match the actual production UI. -> Add a small caption or subtitle indicating this is a trace visualization of the underlying agent protocol.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/proposals-wall-review.gif` @ 00:02: The transition from the spreadsheet view to the Diligence Wall is abrupt and may disorient viewers. -> Add a brief fade transition or slow down the frame rate during the view switch.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/research-enrichment.gif` @ 00:02: The Room trace log at the bottom right scrolls rapidly, making some entries difficult to read. -> Slightly increase the display duration of the final state to allow comfortable reading of the logs.
- **P1** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/wiki-note-grounding.gif` @ 00:01: Abrupt transition from the note view to the spreadsheet view without showing the trigger action. -> Include intermediate frames showing the transition or the user/agent action that initiates the sync.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/ask-agent.gif` @ 00:02: Abrupt zoom transition into the chat input box. -> Smooth out the zoom transition or keep a steady viewport.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/ask-agent.gif` @ 00:05: Bottom caption overlays obscure the lower portion of the chat input and trace log. -> Reduce caption height or place them in a less intrusive position.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/chat.gif` @ 00:06: The orange walkthrough caption banner at the bottom partially overlaps the input field's helper text. -> Reposition or reduce the padding of the walkthrough caption to avoid overlapping UI text.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/ic-room.gif` @ 00:09: The imported account name 'Atlas Maritime Partners' is truncated to 'Atlas Maritime Part...' in the table cell. -> Adjust column width or enable text wrapping to prevent truncation of key entity names.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/review-approve.gif` @ 00:09: The proposal badges and text inside the spreadsheet cells are quite small and may be hard to read on smaller screens. -> Slightly increase the font size of the cell proposals and badges for better legibility.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/two-client-fresh-room.gif` @ 00:03: Spreadsheet text and numbers are quite small and hard to read at standard README display sizes. -> Slightly increase the zoom level of the client windows or crop closer to the active spreadsheet area.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/two-client-live-sync.gif` @ 00:00: The side-by-side view makes the text and spreadsheet cells small and difficult to read initially. -> Increase the default zoom level or crop closer to the active workspace areas.
- **P2** `episodes/private-investment-room-v1/renders/short.mp4` @ 00:23: The version history log text at the bottom of the screen is quite small and difficult to read. -> Increase the font size or add a brief zoom-in effect on the version history panel.
