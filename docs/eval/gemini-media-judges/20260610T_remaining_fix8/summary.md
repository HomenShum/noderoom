## Open Defects

- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/app-manual-edit.gif` @ 00:02: The variance value '+20.5%' appears instantly without showing an active input field or typing state. -> Show a brief typing animation or active cursor state to make the manual edit feel more natural.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/app-research-enrich.gif` @ 00:02: The video remains static from 00:02 to 00:07 after the enrichment completes. -> Trim the trailing static frames to reduce file size and keep the loop snappy.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/app-variance-fill.gif` @ 00:01: Trace log text is quite small and may be hard to read on smaller mobile screens. -> Slightly increase the font size of the trace log panel if possible.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/ask-spreadsheet-cas.gif` @ 00:05: The transition to the private chat panel on the right happens abruptly, making it easy to miss the context shift. -> Add a brief pause or visual transition indicator when the private chat panel updates.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/free-job-halo.gif` @ 00:03: The 'Run collaboration' button appears suddenly without hover state feedback. -> Ensure cursor hover states are captured in the recording to improve interaction clarity.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/proposals-wall-review.gif` @ 00:06: Text in the chat and trace panels is quite small and hard to read at standard resolutions. -> Increase the default font size or zoom the browser slightly during recording.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/research-enrichment.gif` @ 00:06: The trace log text at the bottom is very small and difficult to read at standard preview sizes. -> Increase the font size of the trace log panel or zoom in slightly on the active panel during the transition.
- **P2** `docs/eval/workflow-previews/wiki-note-grounding.gif` @ 00:02: Abrupt transition with a static text overlay 'Open Spreadsheet next' instead of showing the actual click path. -> Show the mouse cursor navigating and clicking the Spreadsheet tab to make the transition feel more natural.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/ask-agent.gif` @ 00:09: The agent fills the spreadsheet cells almost instantaneously, which may look simulated to some viewers. -> Add a brief loading indicator or slow down the playback slightly to reflect realistic agent processing time.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/chat.gif` @ 00:02: The camera zoom into the chat box is sudden and slightly jarring. -> Smooth out the transition or maintain a consistent viewport scale.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/research-upsert.gif` @ 00:06: The text pasting in the import modal is instantaneous, which looks slightly abrupt. -> Add a slight typing delay or transition to make the input feel more natural.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/review-approve.gif` @ 00:09: The proposal badges and cell values are slightly small and dense, making them hard to read at lower resolutions. -> Slightly increase the zoom level of the browser window during recording to improve cell legibility.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/sheet-undo.gif` @ 00:09: The 'Undo' button and version text are small and might be easily missed without the overlay caption. -> Consider adding a subtle visual highlight or zoom effect on the version control panel when undo is clicked.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/two-client-fresh-room.gif` @ 00:06: The text in the chat input and spreadsheet cells is quite small and hard to read in the dual-client layout. -> Consider slightly increasing the default UI font size or applying a tighter crop on the active areas.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/two-client-live-sync.gif` @ 00:01: Text in the full split-screen view is quite small and hard to read before the zoom-in occurs. -> Consider starting with a slightly tighter crop or larger default UI scaling if possible.
- **P2** `episodes/noderoom-live-collab-v1/renders/short.mp4` @ 00:18: Code snippet is highly detailed and hard to read in the brief time shown. -> Simplify the code display or extend the duration of the slide.
- **P2** `episodes/private-investment-room-v1/renders/short.mp4` @ 00:12: Spreadsheet cell values and small labels are difficult to read before the zoom-in occurs. -> Increase the default font size or apply a stronger zoom on the active spreadsheet area during narration.
- **P2** `episodes/stack-before-after-v1/renders/short.mp4` @ 00:21: Abrupt transition between the Streamlit demo slide and the NodeRoom interface. -> Add a subtle fade transition to smooth the visual jump.
