|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `docs/walkthroughs/startup-diligence-live-join.mp4` | readme_walkthrough | publish | 10.9/16 | 0/0/1 | This walkthrough clearly demonstrates multiple users joining a shared startup diligence room using a unique room code, showing real-time collaboration and state synchronization. |
| `docs/walkthroughs/startup-diligence-war-room.mp4` | readme_walkthrough | publish | 11.7/16 | 0/0/2 | The walkthrough effectively demonstrates NodeRoom's multi-agent collaboration and data enrichment capabilities within a realistic startup diligence scenario.

## Open Defects

- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/startup-diligence-live-join.mp4` @ 00:10: The transition between different user perspectives is rapid, which may briefly disorient the viewer. -> Add a subtle visual transition or a slightly longer pause when switching between user browser windows.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/startup-diligence-war-room.mp4` @ 00:07: The Room Trace log text is extremely dense and wraps tightly, reducing legibility. -> Increase line height or add subtle spacing between trace events.
- **P2** `docs/walkthroughs/startup-diligence-war-room.mp4` @ 00:23: The switch from Public to Private copilot is subtle and easy to miss without the overlay text. -> Add a stronger visual indicator or transition effect when switching privacy states.
