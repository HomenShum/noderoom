/**
 * Proof staleness gate (Harness Hardening #7, docs/eval/FEATURE_EVAL_BACKLOG.md).
 *
 * Proofs decay: a committed champion summary is evidence about the route AS IT WAS on
 * generatedAt — providers swap weights and quantization behind stable model ids, so a proof older
 * than the window is a memory, not a claim. This module is the mechanical version of the
 * promotion-rule sentence "stale proofs are labeled, not silently trusted": every summary a
 * marketing surface cites is listed in MARKETED_PROOFS, and the gate goes red when one outlives
 * its window. Re-verify (rerun the batch) or pull the claim — those are the only two green paths.
 *
 * Runs as `npm run proofs:staleness` and inside vitest (tests/proofStaleness.test.ts), so CI
 * going red ~30 days after the last verification is the intended behavior, not a flake.
