/**
 * E2E dogfood harness — the real-DOM layer NodeRoom was missing (see docs/audit/E2E_DOGFOOD_DESIGN.md).
 *
 * Default specs run against the app in MEMORY mode (`/?mode=memory` → the deterministic in-memory
 * RoomEngine), so they need NO Convex backend and NO provider keys — they are green in plain CI and
 * prove the real rendered UI + the optimistic/honest-status paths (Wave 1).
 *
 * Backend-dependent specs (cross-client reactivity, CAS-loser revert) live in *.backend.spec.ts and
 * skip themselves unless E2E_CONVEX_URL is set, because only a real Convex backend can prove reactivity.
