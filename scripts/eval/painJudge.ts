const prompt = `You are an independent product evaluator. You are shown labeled SCREENSHOT FRAMES of a product called NodeRoom (a live room where humans + AI "NodeAgents" co-edit a shared spreadsheet / note / post-it wall via a lock -> draft -> smart-merge + per-cell version model), plus a textual L1-L6 agent task-ladder trace and a benchmark summary.

For each PAIN POINT below, judge whether it is addressed BY THE EVIDENCE SHOWN, using its "addressedIfShown" as the checklist. Be STRICT and HONEST:
- "shown": the addressedIfShown behavior is clearly visible in a frame OR evidenced by the ladder trace/benchmark.
- "partial": some but not all of it is evidenced.
- "not_shown": plausibly built but NOT visible in these frames/trace — do not assume.
- "gap_confirmed": the evidence confirms it is NOT addressed (matches an isGap pain).
Static frames cannot show dynamic behavior (e.g. live conflict recovery) — for those rely on the L1-L6 ladder trace + benchmark; if still not evidenced, say not_shown. Do not reward a pain just because the product looks polished.
