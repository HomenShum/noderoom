// REGRESSION: "That room is full" used to cause infinite flashing. Root cause (see
// docs/COMPONENT_STATE_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md + the App.tsx join effect): the effect's run guard was
// re-satisfied on every failure because `busy` flips true->false in .finally and nothing latched
// the failed attempt. join() therefore re-fired in an unbounded loop. The fix (App.tsx:90,107-108)
// is a per-request `attemptedRef` latch. This test renders the live app driven into the room_full
// path and asserts the join mutation fires EXACTLY ONCE — the assertion that fails pre-fix (the
// count climbs without bound) and passes post-fix.

// hoisted so the vi.mock factory below can close over it (vi.mock is hoisted above plain consts).

// `join` is invoked on the room_full path, so its call count == joinMock's call count. Stability
